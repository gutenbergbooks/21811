<h2 style="font-size:smaller;">TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES</h2>

<p>The source code for this HTML page contains only Latin-1 characters, but
it directs the browser to display some special characters. The original
work contained a few phrases or lines of Greek text. These are
represented here as Greek letters, for example
<span title="Deu~te pi~des, k.t.l.">&#916;&#949;&#8166;&#964;&#949; &#960;&#8150;&#948;&#949;&#962;, &#954;.&#964;.&#955;.</span>.
If the mouse is held still over such phrases, a transliteration in Beta-code pops up.
Aside from Greek letters, the only unusual characters are
&#257; (a with macron), &#299; (i with macron), and &#263; (c with accent).
</p>

<p>An important feature of this edition is its copious footnotes. Footnotes
are indicated by small raised keys in brackets; these are links to the
footnote's text. Footnotes indexed with arabic numbers (e.g. [17],
[221]) are informational. Any text in square brackets is the work of
editor E. H. Coleridge. Unbracketed note text is by Byron himself.
Footnotes indexed with
letters (e.g. [c], [bf]) document variant forms of the text from
manuscripts and other sources.</p>

<p>In the original, footnotes were printed at the foot of the page on which
they were referenced, and their indices started over on each page. In
this etext, footnotes have been collected at the ends of each section,
and have been numbered consecutively throughout.</p>

<p>Navigation aids are provided as follows. Page numbers are displayed at
the right edge of the window.
To jump directly to page <i>nn</i>, append #Page_<i>nn</i> to the document URL.
To jump directly to the text of footnote <i>xx</i>, either search for [<i>xx</i>]
or append #Footnote_<i>xx</i> to the document URL.</p>

<p>Within the blocks of footnotes, numbers in braces such as {321}
represent the page number on which following notes originally appeared.
These numbers are also preserved as HTML anchors of the form Note_321.
To find notes originally printed on page <i>nn</i>, either search
for the string {<i>nn</i>} or append #Note_<i>nn</i> to the document URL.</p>

PREFACE TO THE THIRD VOLUME.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> present volume contains the six metrical tales
which were composed within the years 1812 and 1815,
the <i>Hebrew Melodies</i>, and the minor poems of 1809-1816.
With the exception of the first fifteen poems
(1809-1811)&mdash;<i>Chansons de Voyage</i>, as they might be called&mdash;the
volume as a whole was produced on English soil. Beginning
with the <i>Giaour</i>; which followed in the wake of <i>Childe
Harold</i> and shared its triumph, and ending with the ill-omened

<i>Domestic Pieces</i>, or <i>Poems of the Separation</i>, the
poems which Byron wrote in his own country synchronize
with his popularity as a poet by the acclaim and
suffrages of his own countrymen. His greatest work, by
which his lasting fame has been established, and by
which his relative merits as a great poet will be judged
in the future, was yet to come; but the work which made
his name, which is stamped with his sign-manual, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>which has come to be regarded as distinctively and
characteristically Byronic, preceded maturity and achievement.</p>

<p>No poet of his own or other times, not Walter Scott,
not Tennyson, not Mr. Kipling, was ever in his own
lifetime so widely, so amazingly popular. Thousands
of copies of the "Tales"&mdash;of the <i>Bride of Abydos</i>, of
the <i>Corsair</i>, of <i>Lara</i>&mdash;were sold in a day, and edition
followed edition month in and month out. Everywhere
men talked about the "noble author"&mdash;in the capitals
of Europe, in literary circles in the United States, in
the East Indies. He was "the glass of fashion ... the
observ'd of all observers," the swayer of sentiment, the
master and creator of popular emotion. No other
English poet before or since has divided men's attention
with generals and sea-captains and statesmen, has
attracted and fascinated and overcome the world so
entirely and potently as Lord Byron.</p>

<p>It was <i>Childe Harold</i>, the unfinished, immature <i>Childe
Harold</i>, and the Turkish and other "Tales," which raised
this sudden and deafening storm of applause when the
century was young, and now, at its close (I refer, of
course, to the Tales, not to Byron's poetry as a whole,
which, in spite of the critics, has held and still holds its
own), are ignored if not forgotten, passed over if not
despised&mdash;which but few know thoroughly, and "very
few" are found to admire or to love. <i>Ubi lapsus, quid
feci?</i> might the questioning spirit of the author exclaim
with regard to his "Harrys and Larrys, Pilgrims and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
Pirates," who once held the field, and now seem to have
gone under in the struggle for poetical existence!</p>

<p>To what, then, may we attribute the passing away of
interest and enthusiasm? To the caprice of fashion, to
an insistence on a more faultless <i>technique</i>, to a nicer
taste in ethical sentiment, to a preference for a subtler
treatment of loftier themes? More certainly, and more
particularly, I think, to the blurring of outline and the
blotting out of detail due to lapse of time and the shifting
of the intellectual standpoint.</p>

<p>However much the charm of novelty and the contagion
of enthusiasm may have contributed to the
success of the Turkish and other Tales, it is in the
last degree improbable that our grandfathers and great-grandfathers
were enamoured, not of a reality, but of an
illusion born of ignorance or of vulgar bewilderment.
They were carried away because they breathed the
same atmosphere as the singer; and being undistracted
by ethical, or grammatical, or metrical offences, they not
only read these poems with avidity, but understood
enough of what they read to be touched by their vitality,
to realize their verisimilitude.</p>

<p><i>Tout comprendre c'est tout pardonner.</i> Nay, more, the
knowledge, the comprehension of essential greatness in
art, in nature, or in man is not to know that there is
aught to forgive. But that sufficing knowledge which
the reader of average intelligence brings with him for
the comprehension and appreciation of contemporary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
literature has to be bought at the price of close attention
and patient study when the subject-matter of a poem
and the modes and movements of the poet's consciousness
are alike unfamiliar.</p>

<p>Criticism, however subtle, however suggestive, however
luminous, will not bridge over the gap between the
past and the present, will not supply the sufficing knowledge.
It is delightful and interesting and, in a measure,
instructive to know what great poets of his own time and
of ours have thought of Byron, how he "strikes" them;
but unless we are ourselves saturated with his thought and
style, unless we learn to breathe his atmosphere by reading
the books which he read, picturing to ourselves the
scenes which he saw,&mdash;unless we aspire to his ideals and
suffer his limitations, we are in no way entitled to judge
his poems, whether they be good or bad.</p>

<p>Byron's metrical "Tales" come before us in the
guise of light reading, and may be "easily criticized"
as melo-dramatic&mdash;the heroines conventional puppets,
the heroes reduplicated reflections of the author's personality,
the Oriental "properties" loosely arranged, and
somewhat stage-worn. A thorough and sympathetic study
of these once extravagantly lauded and now belittled
poems will not, perhaps, reverse the deliberate judgment
of later generations, but it will display them for what
they are, bold and rapid and yet exact presentations of
the "gorgeous East," vivid and fresh from the hand of
the great artist who conceived them out of the abundance<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>

of memory and observation, and wrought them into shape
with the "pen of a ready writer." They will be once
more recognized as works of genius, an integral portion
of our literary inheritance, which has its proper value,
and will repay a more assiduous and a finer husbandry.</p>

<p>I have once more to acknowledge the generous
assistance of the officials of the British Museum, and,
more especially, of Mr. A. G. Ellis, of the Oriental
Printed Books and MSS. Department, who has afforded
me invaluable instruction in the compilation of the notes
to the <i>Giaour</i> and <i>Bride of Abydos</i>.</p>

<p>I have also to thank Mr. R. L. Binyon, of the
Department of Prints and Drawings, for advice and
assistance in the selection of illustrations.</p>

<p>I desire to express my cordial thanks to the Registrar
of the Copyright Office, Stationers' Hall; to Professor
Jannaris, of the University of St. Andrews; to Miss
E. Dawes, M.A., D.L., of Heathfield Lodge, Weybridge;
to my cousin, Miss Edith Coleridge, of Goodrest, Torquay;
and to my friend, Mr. Frank E. Taylor, of Chertsey,
for information kindly supplied during the progress of
the work.</p>

<p>For many of the "parallel passages" from the works
of other poets, which are to be found in the notes, I am
indebted to a series of articles by A. A. Watts, in the
<i>Literary Gazette,</i> February and March, 1821; and to the
notes to the late Professor E. Kolbing's <i>Siege of Corinth.</i></p>

<p>On behalf of the publisher, I beg to acknowledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
the kindness of Lord Glenesk, and of Sir Theodore
Martin, K.C.B., who have permitted the examination
and collation of MSS. of the <i>Siege of Corinth</i> and of the
"Thyrza" poems, in their possession.</p>

<p>The original of the miniature of H.R.H. the Princess
Charlotte of Wales (see p. 44) is in the Library of
Windsor Castle. It has been reproduced for this volume
by the gracious permission of Her Majesty the Queen.</p>

INTRODUCTION TO THE <i>OCCASIONAL PIECES</i><br />
(<i>POEMS</i> 1809-1813; <i>POEMS</i> 1814-1816).
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Poems afterwards entitled "Occasional Pieces," which
were included in the several editions of the Collected Works
issued by Murray, 1819-1831, numbered fifty-seven in all.
They may be described as the aggregate of the shorter
poems written between the years 1809-1818, which the
author thought worthy of a permanent place among his
poetical works. Of these the first twenty-nine appeared in
successive editions of <i>Childe Harold</i> (Cantos I., II.)
&laquo;viz. fourteen in the first edition, twenty in the second, and
twenty-nine in the seventh edition&raquo;, while the thirtieth, the
<i>Ode on the Death of Sir Peter Parker</i>, was originally
attached to <i>Hebrew Melodies</i>. The remaining twenty-seven
pieces consist of six poems first published in the Second
Edition of the <i>Corsair,</i> 1814; eleven which formed the
collection entitled "Poems," 1816; six which were appended
to the <i>Prisoner of Chillon</i>, December, 1816; the <i>Very
Mournful Ballad</i>, and the <i>Sonnet by Vittorelli</i>, which
accompanied the Fourth Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>, 1818;
the <i>Sketch</i>, first included by Murray in his edition of 1819;
and the <i>Ode to Venice</i>, which appeared in the same volume
as <i>Mazeppa</i>.</p>

<p>Thus matters stood till 1831, when seventy new poems
(sixty had been published by Moore, in <i>Letters and
Journals</i>, 1830, six were republished from Hobhouse's
<i>Imitations and Translations</i>, 1809, and four derived from
other sources) were included in a sixth volume of the Collected Works.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span></p>

<p>In the edition of 1832-35, twenty-four new poems were
added, but four which had appeared in <i>Letters and Journals</i>,
1830, and in the sixth volume of the edition of 1831 were
omitted. In the one-volume edition (first issued in 1837
and still in print), the four short pieces omitted in 1832 once
more found a place, and the lines on "John Keats," first
published in <i>Letters and Journals</i>, and the two stanzas to
Lady Caroline Lamb, "Remember thee! remember thee,"
first printed by Medwin, in the <i>Conversations of Lord Byron</i>,
1824, were included in the Collection.</p>

<p>The third volume of the present issue includes all minor
poems (with the exception of epigrams and <i>jeux d'esprit</i>
reserved for the sixth volume) written after Byron's departure
for the East in July, 1809, and before he left England for
good in April, 1816.</p>

<p>The "Separation" and its consequent exile afforded a
pretext and an opportunity for the publication of a crop of
spurious verses. Of these <i>Madame Lavalette</i> (first published
in the <i>Examiner</i>, January 21, 1816, under the signature B.B.,
and immediately preceding a genuine sonnet by Wordsworth,
"How clear, how keen, how marvellously bright!") and
<i>Oh Shame to thee, Land of the Gaul!</i> included by Hone,
in <i>Poems on his Domestic Circumstances</i>, 1816; and

<i>Farewell to England</i>,
<i>Ode to the Isle of St. Helena</i>,
<i>To the Lily of France</i>,
<i>On the Morning of my Daughter's Birth</i>,
published by J. Johnston, 1816, were repudiated by Byron, in
a letter to Murray, dated July 22, 1816. A longer poem
entitled <i>The Tempest</i>, which was attached to the spurious
<i>Pilgrimage to the Holy Land</i>, published by Johnston, "the
Cheapside impostor," in 1817, was also denounced by Byron
as a forgery in a letter to Murray, dated December 16, 1816.</p>

<p>The <i>Triumph of the Whale</i>, by Charles Lamb, and the

<i>Enigma on the Letter H</i>, by Harriet Fanshawe, were often
included in piratical editions of Byron's <i>Poetical Works</i>.
Other attributed poems which found their way into newspapers
and foreign editions, viz.
(i.) <i>To my dear Mary Anne</i>, 1804, "Adieu to sweet Mary for ever;"
and (ii.) <i>To Miss Chaworth</i>, "Oh, memory, torture me no more," 1804,
published in <i>Works of Lord Byron</i>, Paris, 1828;
(iii.) lines written <i>In the Bible</i>,
"Within this awful volume lies," quoted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
in <i>Life, Writings, Opinions, etc</i>., 1825, iii. 414;
(iv.) lines addressed to (?) George Anson Byron,
"And dost thou ask the reason of my sadness?" <i>Nicnac</i>, March 29, 1823;
(v.) <i>To Lady Caroline Lamb</i>, "And sayst thou that I have not felt,"
published in <i>Works, etc</i>., 1828;
(vi.) lines <i>To her who can best understand them</i>,
"Be it so, we part for ever," published in the

<i>Works of Lord Byron, In Verse and Prose</i>, Hartford, 1847;
(vii.) <i>Lines found in the Travellers' Book at Chamouni</i>,
"How many numbered are, how few agreed!" published
<i>Works, etc</i>., 1828;
and (viii.) a second copy of verses with the same title,
"All hail, Mont Blanc! Mont-au-Vert, hail!"
<i>Life, Writings, etc</i>., 1825, ii. 384;
(ix.) <i>Lines addressed by Lord Byron to Mr. Hobhouse on
his Election for Westminster</i>,
"Would you get to the house by the true gate?"
<i>Works, etc</i>., 1828; and
(x.) <i>Enigma on the Letter I</i>, "I am not in youth,
nor in manhood, nor age," <i>Works, etc</i>., Paris, p. 720,
together with sundry epigrams, must, failing the production of the
original MSS., be accounted forgeries, or, perhaps, in one
or two instances, of doubtful authenticity.</p>

<p>The following poems: <i>On the Quotation</i>,
"<i>And my true faith</i>" etc.; [<i>Love and Gold</i>];
<i>Julian</i> [<i>a Fragment</i>]; and
<i>On the Death of the Duke of Dorset</i>,
are now published for
the first time from MSS. in the possession of Mr. John
Murray.</p>

Smith, the "Lady" of the lines <i>To Florence</i>, "the sweet Florence"

and, finally, when "The Spell is broke, the Charm is flown,"
the "fair Florence" of stanzas xxxii., xxxiii. of the
Second Canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>. In a
letter to his mother, dated September 15, 1809, Byron writes, "This
letter is committed to the charge of a very extraordinary woman,
whom you have doubtless heard of, Mrs. Spencer Smith, of whose
escape the Marquis de Salvo published a narrative a few years ago
(<i>Travels in the Year 1806, from Italy to England through the Tyrol,
etc., containing the particulars of the liberation of Mrs. Spencer Smith
from the hands of the French Police</i>, London: 12mo, 1807). She
has since been shipwrecked, and her life has been from its commencement
so fertile in remarkable incidents, that in a romance they would
appear improbable. She was born at Constantinople [<i>circ.</i> 1785],
where her father, Baron Herbert, was Austrian Ambassador;
married unhappily, yet has never been impeached in point of
character; excited the vengeance of Buonaparte by a part in some
conspiracy; several times risked her life; and is not yet twenty-five."

</p><p>
John Spencer Smith, the "Lady's" husband, was a younger
brother of Admiral Sir Sidney Smith, the hero of the siege of Acre.
He began life as a Page of Honour to Queen Charlotte, was, afterwards,
attached to the Turkish Embassy, and (May 4, 1798)
appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. On January 5, 1799, he concluded
the treaty of defensive alliance with the Porte; and, October
30, 1799, obtained the freedom of the Black Sea for the English
flag (see <i>Remains of the late John Tweddell</i>. London: 1815. See,
too, for Mrs. Spencer Smith, <i>Letters</i>, 1898, i. 244, 245, note 1).]

</p><p>
[This thunderstorm occurred during the night of the 11th October,
1809, when Lord Byron's guides had lost the road to Zitza, near the
range of mountains formerly called Pindus, in Albania. Hobhouse,
who had ridden on before the rest of the party, and arrived at Zitza
just as the evening set in, describes the thunder as rolling "without
intermission&mdash;the echoes of one peal had not ceased to roll in the
mountains, before another tremendous crash burst over our heads,
whilst the plains and the distant hills, visible through the cracks in
the cabin, appeared in a perpetual blaze. The tempest was altogether
terrific, and worthy of the Grecian Jove. Lord Byron, with
the priest and the servants, did not enter our hut before three
(in the morning). I now learnt from him that they had lost their way, ...
and that after wandering up and down in total ignorance of their
position, had, at last, stopped near some Turkish tombstones and a
torrent, which they saw by the flashes of lightning. They had been
thus exposed for nine hours. ... It was long before we ceased to
talk of the thunderstorm in the plain of Zitza."&mdash;<i>Travels in Albania</i>,

On the 3rd of May, 1810, while the <i>Salsette</i> (Captain Bathurst)
was lying in the Dardanelles, Lieutenant Ekenhead, of that frigate,
and the writer of these rhymes, swam from the European shore to
the Asiatic&mdash;by the by, from Abydos to Sestos would have been
more correct. The whole distance, from the place whence we started
to our landing on the other side, including the length we were
carried by the current, was computed by those on board the frigate
at upwards of four English miles, though the actual breadth is barely
one. The rapidity of the current is such that no boat can row
directly across, and it may, in some measure, be estimated from the
circumstance of the whole distance being accomplished by one of the
parties in an hour and five, and by the other in an hour and ten
minutes. The water was extremely cold, from the melting of the
mountain snows. About three weeks before, in April, we had made
an attempt; but having ridden all the way from the Troad the same
morning, and the water being of an icy chillness, we found it necessary
to postpone the completion till the frigate anchored below the
castles, when we swam the straits as just stated, entering a considerable
way above the European, and landing below the Asiatic, fort.
[Le] Chevalier says that a young Jew swam the same distance for his
mistress; and Olivier mentions its having been done by a Neapolitan;
but our consul, Tarragona, remembered neither of these circumstances,
and tried to dissuade us from the attempt. A number of the
<i>Salsette's</i> crew were known to have accomplished a greater distance;
and the only thing that surprised me was that, as doubts had been
entertained of the truth of Leander's story, no traveller had ever
endeavoured to ascertain its practicability. [See letter to Drury,
dated May 3; to his mother, May 24, 1810, etc. (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, i.

sisters, daughters of Theodora Macri, the widow of a former English
vice-consul. Byron and Hobhouse lodged at her house. The sisters
were sought out and described by the artist, Hugh W. Williams,
who visited Athens in May, 1817: "Theresa, the Maid of Athens,
Catinco, and Mariana, are of middle stature.... The two eldest
have black, or dark hair and eyes; their visage oval, and complexion
somewhat pale, with teeth of pearly whiteness. Their cheeks are
rounded, their noses straight, rather inclined to aquiline. The
youngest, Mariana, is very fair, her face not so finely rounded, but
has a gayer expression than her sisters', whose countenances, except
when the conversation has something of mirth in it, may be said to
be rather pensive. Their persons are elegant, and their manners
pleasing and lady-like, such as would be fascinating in any country.
They possess very considerable powers of conversation, and their
minds seem to be more instructed than those of the Greek women in
general."&mdash;<i>Travels in Italy, Greece, etc.</i>, ii. 291, 292.
</p><p>
Other travellers, Hughes, who visited Athens in 1813, and Walsh
(<i>Narrative of a Resident in Constantinople</i>, i. 122),
who saw Theresa in 1821, found her charming and interesting,
but speak of her beauty as a thing of the past.
"She married an Englishman named Black,
employed in H.M. Consular Service at Mesolonghi. She survived
her husband and fell into great poverty.... Theresa Black died
October 15, 1875, aged 80 years."

"Maid of Athens" is possibly the best-known of Byron's short
poems, all over the English-speaking world. This is no doubt due
in part to its having been set to music by about half a dozen
composers&mdash;the latest of whom was Gounod.]</p></div>

In a curious work of doubtful authority, entitled, <i>The Life,

London, 1825 (iii. 123-132), there is a long and circumstantial
narrative of a "defeated" attempt of Byron's to rescue a Georgian
girl, whom he had bought in the slave-market for 800 piastres, from
a life of shame and degradation. It is improbable that these verses
suggested the story; and, on the other hand, the story, if true, does

He explains in a footnote that the metre is "a mixed
trochaic, except the chorus." "This song," he adds, "the chorus

"There can be no doubt that Lord Byron referred to Thyrza in
conversation with Lady Byron, and probably also with Mrs. Leigh,
as a young girl who had existed, and the date of whose death almost
coincided with Lord Byron's landing in England in 1811. On one
occasion he showed Lady Byron a beautiful tress of hair, which she
understood to be Thyrza's. He said he had never mentioned her
name, and that now she was gone his breast was the sole depository
of that secret. 'I took the name of Thyrza from Gesner. She was
Abel's wife.'
</p><p>
"Thyrza is mentioned in a letter from Elizabeth, Duchess of Devonshire,
to Augustus Foster (London, May 4, 1812): 'Your little
friend, Caro William (Lady Caroline Lamb), as usual, is doing all
sorts of imprudent things for him (Lord Byron) and with him; he
admires her very much, but is supposed by some to admire our
Caroline (the Hon. Mrs. George Lamb) more; he says she is like
Thyrsa, and her singing is enchantment to him.' From this extract
it is obvious that Thyrza is alluded to in the following lines, which,
with the above quotation, may be reproduced, by kind permission
of Mr. Vere Foster, from his most interesting book, <i>The Two
Duchesses</i> (1898, pp. 362-374).

(It may be noted that the name Thirza, or Thyrza, a variant of
Theresa, had been familiar to Byron in his childhood. In the
Preface to <i>Cain</i> he writes,
"Gesner's <i>Death of Abel!</i> I have never
read since I was eight years of age at Aberdeen. The general
impression of my recollection is delight; but of the contents I
remember only that Cain's wife was called Mahala, and Abel's
Thirza." Another and more immediate suggestion of the name
may be traced to the following translation of Meleager's Epitaphium
<i>In Heliodoram</i>, which one of the "associate bards," Bland, or
Merivale, or Hodgson, contributed to their
<i>Translations chiefly from the Greek Anthology</i>,
1806, p. 4, a work which Byron singles out for
commendation in <i>English Bards</i>, etc, (lines 881-890):&mdash;

[The scene which begat these memorable stanzas was enacted
at a banquet at Carlton House, February 22, 1812. On March 6 the
following quatrain, entitled, "Impromptu on a Recent Incident,"
appeared in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>:&mdash;

</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Blest omens of a happy reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In swift succession hourly rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsaken friends, vows made in vain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A daughter's tears, a nation's sighs."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p>
Byron's lines, headed, "Sympathetic Address to a Young Lady,"
were published anonymously in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> of March 7,
but it was not till March 10 that the <i>Courier</i> ventured to insert a
report of "The Fracas at Carlton House on the 22nd ult.," which
had already been communicated to the <i>Caledonian Mercury</i>.

</p>
<blockquote><p>"The party consisted of the Princess Charlotte, the Duchess of
York, the Dukes of York and Cambridge, Lords Moira, Erskine,
Lauderdale, Messrs. Adams and Sheridan.
</p><p>
"The Prince Regent expressed 'his surprise and mortification'
at the conduct of Lords Grey and Grenville [who had replied unfavourably
to a letter addressed by the P.R. to the Duke of York,
suggesting an united administration]. Lord Lauderdale thereupon,
with a freedom unusual in courts, asserted that the reply did not
express the opinions of Lords Grey and Grenville only, but of every
political friend of that way of thinking, and that he had been present
at and assisted in the drawing-up, and that every sentence had his
cordial assent. The Prince was suddenly and deeply affected by
Lord Lauderdale's reply, so much so, that the Princess, observing
his agitation, dropt her head and burst into tears&mdash;upon which the
Prince turned round and begged the female part of the company to
withdraw."</p></blockquote>
<p>
In the following June, at a ball at Miss Johnson's, Byron was
"presented by order to our gracious Regent, who honoured me
with some conversation," and for a time he ignored and perhaps
regretted his anonymous <i>jeu d'esprit</i>. But early in 1814, either out
of mere bravado or in an access of political rancour, he determined
to republish the stanzas under his own name. The first edition of
the <i>Corsair</i> was printed, if not published, but in accordance with
a peremptory direction (January 22, 1814), "eight lines on the little
Royalty weeping in 1812," were included among the poems printed
at the end of the second edition.
</p><p>
The "newspapers were in hysterics and town in an uproar on
the avowal and republication" of the stanzas (<i>Diary</i>, February 18),
and during Byron's absence from town "Murray omitted the Tears
in several of the copies"&mdash;that is, in the Third Edition&mdash;but yielding
to <i>force majeure</i>, replaced them in a Fourth Edition, which was
issued early in February. (See Letters of July 6, 1812, January 22,
February 2, and February 10, 1814 (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 134, etc.);
and for "Newspaper Attacks upon Byron," see <i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii.

Busby forced his way on to the stage of Drury Lane, attempted

competitor and the author of an 'Unalogue'...) to make himself
heard, Byron alludes in the stage direction, 'to be spoken in an

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION_GIAOUR" id="INTRODUCTION_GIAOUR"></a>
INTRODUCTION TO <i>THE GIAOUR</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a letter to Murray, dated Pisa, December 12, 1821
(<i>Life</i>, p. 545), Byron avows that the "Giaour Story" had actually
"some foundation on facts." Soon after the poem appeared
(June 5, 1813), "a story was circulated by some gentlewomen
... a little too close to the text" (Letters to Moore,
September 1, 1813, <i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 258), and in order to
put himself right with his friends or posterity, Byron wrote
to his friend Lord Sligo, who in July, 1810, was anchored off
Athens in "a twelve-gun brig, with a crew of fifty men" (see

<i>Letters</i>, 1898, i. 289, note 1), requesting him to put on paper
not so much the narrative of an actual event, but "what he
had heard at Athens about the affair of that girl who was so
near being put an end to while you were there." According
to the letter which Moore published (<i>Life</i>, p. 178), and which
is reprinted in the present issue (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 257),
Byron interposed on behalf of a girl, who "in compliance with the
strict letter of the Mohammedan law," had been sewn in a
sack and was about to be thrown into the sea. "I was told,"
adds Lord Sligo, "that you then conveyed her in safety to the
convent, and despatched her off at night to Thebes." The
letter, which Byron characterizes as "curious," is by no means
conclusive, and to judge from the designedly mysterious
references in the Journal, dated November 16 and December
5, and in the second postscript to a letter to Professor
Clarke, dated December 15, 1813 (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 321, 361,
311), "the circumstances which were the groundwork" are
not before us. "An event," says John Wright (ed. 1832, ix.
145), "in which Lord Byron was personally concerned, undoubtedly
supplied the groundwork of this tale; but for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
story so circumstantially set forth (see Medwin's <i>Conversations</i>,
1824, pp. 121, 124) of his having been the lover of this
female slave, there is no foundation. The girl whose life the
poet saved at Athens was not, we are assured by Sir John
Hobhouse (<i>Westminster Review</i>, January, 1825, iii. 27), an
object of his Lordship's attachment, but of that of his
Turkish servant." Nevertheless, whatever Byron may have
told Hobhouse (who had returned to England), and he distinctly
says (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 393) that he did not tell him
everything, he avowed to Clarke that he had been led
"to the water's edge," and confided to his diary that to
"describe the <i>feelings</i> of <i>that</i> situation was
impossible&mdash;it is <i>icy</i> even to recollect them."</p>

<p>For the allusive and fragmentary style of the <i>Giaour</i>,
<i>The Voyage of Columbus</i>, which Rogers published in 1812, is in
part responsible. "It is sudden in its transitions," wrote
the author, in the Preface to the first edition, "... leaving
much to be imagined by the reader." The story or a part
of it is told by a fellow-seaman of Columbus, who had turned
"eremite" in his old age, and though the narrative itself is
in heroic verse, the prologue and epilogue, as they may be
termed, are in "the romance or ballad-measure of the Spanish."
The resemblance between the two poems is
certainly more than accidental. On the other hand, a vivid
and impassioned description of Oriental scenery and customs
was, as Gifford observed, new and original, and though, by his
own admission, Byron was indebted to <i>Vathek</i> (or rather
S. Henley's notes to <i>Vathek</i>) and to D'Herbelot's
<i>Biblioth&egrave;que Orientale</i> for allusions and details, the "atmosphere"
could only have been reproduced by the creative fancy of an
observant and enthusiastic traveller who had lived under
Eastern skies, and had come within ken of Eastern life and
sentiment.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of his love for the subject-matter of his
poem, and the facility, surprising even to himself, with which
he spun his rhymes, Byron could not persuade himself that
a succession of fragments would sort themselves and grow
into a complete and connected whole. If his thrice-repeated
depreciation of the <i>Giaour</i> is not entirely genuine, it is plain
that he misdoubted himself. Writing to Murray (August 26,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
1813) he says, "I have, but with some difficulty, <i>not</i> added
any more to this snake of a poem, which has been lengthening
its rattles every month;" to Moore (September 1),
"The <i>Giaour</i> I have added to a good deal, but still in foolish
fragments;" and, again, to Moore (September 8), "By the
coach I send you a copy of that awful pamphlet the <i>Giaour</i>."</p>

<p>But while the author doubted and apologized, or deprecated
"his love's excess In words of wrong and bitterness,"
the public read, and edition followed edition with bewildering speed.</p>

<p>The <i>Giaour</i> was reviewed by George Agar Ellis in the
<i>Quarterly</i> (No. xxxi., January, 1813 [published February 11,
1813]) and in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> by Jeffrey (No. 54,
January, 1813 [published February 24, 1813]).

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE ON <i>THE GIAOUR</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> bibliography of the <i>Giaour</i> is beset with difficulties,
and it is doubtful if more than approximate accuracy can be
secured. The composition of the entire poem in its present
shape was accomplished within six months, May-November,
1813, but during that period it was expanded by successive
accretions from a first draft of 407 lines (extant in MS.) to a
seventh edition of 1334 lines. A proof is extant of an edition
of 28 pages containing 460 lines, itself an enlargement on
the MS.; but whether (as a note in the handwriting of the
late Mr. Murray affirms) this was or was not published is
uncertain. A portion of a second proof of 38 pages has been
preserved, but of the publication of the poem in this state
there is no record. On June 5 a first edition of 41 pages,
containing 685 lines, was issued, and of this numerous copies
are extant. At the end of June, or the beginning of July,
1813, a second edition, entitled, a "New Edition with some
Additions," appeared. This consisted of 47 pages, and
numbered 816 lines. Among the accretions is to be found
the famous passage beginning, "He that hath bent him o'er
the dead." Two MS. copies of this <i>pannus vere purpureus</i>
are in Mr. Murray's possession. At the end of July, and
during the first half of August, two or more issues of a third
edition were set up in type. The first issue amounted to 53
pages, containing 950 lines, was certainly published in this
form, and possibly a second issue of 56 pages, containing
1004 lines, may have followed at a brief interval. A revise
of this second issue, dated August 13, is extant. In the last
fortnight of August a fourth edition of 58 pages, containing
1048 lines, undoubtedly saw the light. Scarcely more than
a few days can have elapsed before a fifth edition of 66 pages,

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
containing 1215 lines, was ready to supplant the fourth
edition. A sixth edition, a reproduction of the fifth, may
have appeared in October. A seventh edition of 75 pages,
containing 1334 lines, which presented the poem in its final
shape, was issued subsequently to November 27, 1813 (a
seventh edition was advertised in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>,
December 22, 1813), the date of the last revise, or of an
advance copy of the issue. The ninth, tenth, eleventh, and
twelfth editions belong to 1814, while a fourteenth edition is
known to have been issued in 1815. In that year and henceforward
the <i>Giaour</i> was included in the various collected
editions of Byron's works. The subjoined table assigns to
their several editions the successive accretions in their order
as now published:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tale which these disjointed fragments present, is
founded upon circumstances now less common in the
East than formerly; either because the ladies are
more circumspect than in the "olden time," or because
the Christians have better fortune, or less enterprise.
The story, when entire, contained the adventures of a
female slave, who was thrown, in the Mussulman manner,
into the sea for infidelity, and avenged by a young
Venetian, her lover, at the time the Seven Islands were
possessed by the Republic of Venice, and soon after the
Arnauts were beaten back from the Morea, which they
had ravaged for some time subsequent to the Russian
invasion. The desertion of the Mainotes, on being
refused the plunder of Misitra, led to the abandonment
of that enterprise, and to the desolation of the Morea,
during which the cruelty exercised on all sides was
unparalleled even in the annals of the faithful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

by some supposed the sepulchre of Themistocles.

Plato upon the tomb of Themistocles, which have a turn of elegant
and pathetic simplicity in them, that deserves a better translation
than I can give&mdash;

The traditional site of the tomb of Themistocles, "a rock-hewn
grave on the very margin of the sea generally covered with water,"
adjoins the lighthouse, which stands on the westernmost promontory
of the Pir&aelig;us, some three quarters of a mile from the entrance to
the harbour. Plutarch, in his <i>Themistocles</i> (cap. xxxii.), is at pains
to describe the exact site of the "altar-like tomb," and quotes the
passage from Plato (the comic poet, B.C. 428-389) which Cumberland
paraphrases. Byron and Hobhouse "made the complete circuit
of the peninsula of Munychia," January 18, 1810.&mdash;<i>Travels in
Albania</i>, 1858, i. 317, 318.]</p></div>

witnessing what is here attempted in description; but those who
have will probably retain a painful remembrance of that singular
beauty which pervades, with few exceptions, the features of the dead,
a few hours, and but for a few hours, after "the spirit is not there."
It is to be remarked in cases of violent death by gun-shot wounds,
the expression is always that of languor, whatever the natural energy
of the sufferer's character; but in death from a stab the countenance
preserves its traits of feeling or ferocity, and the mind its bias, to
the last. [According to Medwin (1824, 4to, p. 223), an absurd
charge, based on the details of this note, was brought against Byron,
that he had been guilty of murder, and spoke from experience.]</p></div>

associated with the Arabic <i>jawr</i>, a "deviating" or "erring," the
initial consonant would be soft, but if with the Persian <i>gawr</i>,
or <i>guebre</i>, "a fire-worshipper," the word should be pronounced
<i>Gow-er</i>&mdash;as Gower Street has come to be pronounced. It is to be
remarked that to the present day the Nestorians of Urumiah are
contemned as <i>Gy-ours</i> (the <i>G</i> hard), by their Mohammedan
countrymen.&mdash;(From information kindly supplied by Mr. A. G. Ellis, of the

[James Bruce, 1730-1794 (nicknamed "Abyssinian Bruce"), gives
a remarkable description of the simoom: "I saw from the south-east
a haze come, in colour like the purple part of the rainbow, but not
so compressed or thick. It did not occupy twenty yards in breadth,
and was about twelve feet high from the ground. It was a kind of
blush upon the air, and it moved very rapidly.... We all lay
flat on the ground ... till it was blown over. The meteor, or
purple haze, which I saw was, indeed, passed, but the light air
which still blew was of a heat to threaten suffocation." He goes on
to say that he did not recover the effect of the sandblast on his chest
for nearly two years

so placed for experiment by gentle philosophers. Some maintain that the position
of the sting, when turned towards the head, is merely a convulsive
movement; but others have actually brought in the verdict "Felo de se."
The scorpions are surely interested in a speedy decision of
the question; as, if once fairly established as insect Catos, they will
probably be allowed to live as long as they think proper, without
being martyred for the sake of an hypothesis.

"Probably in some instances the poor scorpion has been burnt to
death; and the well-known habit of these creatures to raise the tail
over the back and recurve it so that the extremity touches the

In the First Edition, "Giamschid" was written as a word of three
syllables; so D'Herbelot has it; but I am told Richardson reduces
it to a dissyllable, and writes "Jamshid." I have left in the text
the orthography of the one with the pronunciation of the other.
</p><p>
[The MS. and First Edition read,
"Bright as the gem of Giamschid." Byron's first intention was to
change the line into "Bright as the ruby of Giamschid;"
but to this Moore objected,
"that as the comparison of his heroine's eye to a ruby might
unluckily call up the idea of its being bloodshot,
he had better change the line to 'Bright as the jewel,' etc."
</p><p>
For the original of Byron's note, see S. Henley's note, <i>Vathek,</i>

1893, p. 230. See, too, D'Herbelot's <i>Biblioth&egrave;que Orientale</i>, 1781,
iii. 27.
</p><p>
Sir Richard Burton (<i>Arabian Nights, S.N.</i>, iii. 440) gives the
following <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of the conflicting legends: "J&aacute;m-i-j&aacute;mshid is a
well-known commonplace in Moslem folk-lore; but commentators
cannot agree whether 'J&aacute;m' be a mirror or a cup. In the latter
sense it would represent the Cyathomantic cup of the Patriarch
Joseph, and the symbolic bowl of Nestor. Jamshid may be translated
either 'Jam the bright,' or 'the Cup of the Sun;' this ancient
king is the Solomon of the grand old Guebres."
</p><p>
Fitzgerald, "in a very composite quatrain (stanza v.) which cannot
be claimed as a translation at all" (see the <i>Rub&aacute;iy&aacute;t</i> of Omar
Khayya&#257;m, by Edward Heron Allen, 1898), embodies a late version

famished spider, and sharper than the edge of a sword, over which
the Mussulmans must <i>skate</i> into Paradise, to which it is the only
entrance; but this is not the worst, the river beneath being hell
itself, into which, as may be expected, the unskilful and tender of
foot contrive to tumble with a "facilis descensus Averni," not very
pleasing in prospect to the next passenger. There is a shorter cut
downwards for the Jews and Christians.
</p><p>
[Byron is again indebted to <i>Vathek</i>, and S. Henley on <i>Vathek,</i>

p. 237, for his information. The authority for the legend of the
Bridge of Paradise is not the Koran, but the Book of Mawakef,
quoted by Edward Pococke, in his Commentary (<i>Not&aelig; Miscellane&aelig;</i>)
on the <i>Porta Mosis</i> of Moses Maimonides (Oxford, 1654, p. 288)&mdash;
</p><p>
"Stretched across the back of Hell, it is narrower than a javelin,
sharper than the edge of a sword. But all must essay the passage,
believers as well as infidels, and it baffles the understanding to
imagine in what manner they keep their foothold."
</p><p>
The legend, or rather allegory, to which there would seem to be
some allusion in the words of Scripture, "Strait is the gate," etc.,
is of Zoroastrian origin. Compare the <i>Zend-Avesta</i>, Yasna xix. 6
(<i>Sacred Books of the East</i>, edited by F. Max Muller, 1887, xxxi. 261),
"With even threefold (safety and with speed) I will bring his
soul over the Bridge of Kinvat," etc.]</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_88" id="Footnote_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_88"><span class="label">[88]</span></a> <a id="Note_110"></a>{110} A vulgar error: the Koran allots at least a third of Paradise
to well-behaved women; but by far the greater number of Mussulmans
interpret the text their own way, and exclude their moieties
from heaven. Being enemies to Platonics, they cannot discern "any
fitness of things" in the souls of the other sex, conceiving them to
be superseded by the Houris.
</p><p>
[Sale, in his <i>Preliminary Discourse</i> ("Chandos Classics," p. 80),
in dealing with this question, notes "that there are several passages
in the Koran which affirm that women, in the next life, will not
only be punished for their evil actions, but will also receive the
rewards of their good deeds, as well as the men, and that in this
case God will make no distinction of sexes." A single quotation
will suffice: "God has promised to believers, men and women,
gardens beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein for aye; and
goodly places in the garden of Eden."&mdash;<i>The Qur'&acirc;n</i>, translated
by E. H. Palmer, 1880, vi. 183.]</p></div>

quotes about these "Vroucolochas" ["Vroucolocasses"], as he calls them.
The Romaic term is "Vardoulacha."
I recollect a whole family being terrified by the scream of a child,
which they imagined must proceed from such a visitation. The
Greeks never mention the word without horror. I find that
"Broucolokas" is an old legitimate Hellenic appellation&mdash;at least
is so applied to Arsenius, who, according to the Greeks, was after
his death animated by the Devil. The moderns, however, use the
word I mention.

Arsenius, Archbishop of Monembasia (circ. 1530), was famous for
his scholarship. He prefaced his <i>Scholia in Septem Euripidis Trag&aelig;dias</i>
(Basile&aelig;, 1544) by a dedicatory epistle in Greek to his
friend Pope Paul III. "He submitted to the Church of Rome,
which made him so odious to the Greek schismatics that the
Patriarch of Constantinople excommunicated him; and the Greeks
reported that Arsenius, after his death, was <i>Broukolakas</i>, that
is, that the Devil hovered about his corps and re-animated him"
(Bayle, <i>Dictionary</i>, 1724, i. 508, art. "Arsenius"). Martinus
Crusius, in his <i>Turco-Gr&aelig;cia</i>, lib. ii. (Basile&aelig;, 1584, p. 151)
records the death of Arsenius while under sentence of excommunication,
and adds that "his miserable corpse turned black, and
swelled to the size of a drum, so that all who beheld it were horror-stricken,
and trembled exceedingly." Hence, no doubt, the legend
which Bayle takes <i>verbatim</i> from Guillet,
"Les Grecs disent qu' Arsenius, apres la mort fust <i>Broukolakas</i>," etc.
(<i>Lac&eacute;d&eacute;mone, Ancienne et Nouvelle</i>, par Le Sieur de la Guilleti&eacute;re,
1676, ii. 586.
See, too, for "Arsenius," Fabricii <i>Script. Gr. Var.</i>, 1808, xi. 581,
and Gesneri <i>Bibliotheca Univ</i>., ed. 1545, fol. 96.) Byron, no doubt,
got his information from Bayle. By "old legitimate Hellenic"
he must mean literary as opposed to klephtic Greek.]</p>

signs of a Vampire. The stories told in Hungary and Greece of these
foul feeders are singular, and some of them most <i>incredibly</i> attested.
</p><p>
[Vampires were the reanimated corpses of persons newly buried,
which were supposed to suck the blood and suck out the life of their
selected victims. The marks by which a vampire corpse was recognized
were the apparent non-putrefaction of the body and effusion of
blood from the lips. A suspected vampire was exhumed, and if the
marks were perceived or imagined to be present, a stake was driven
through the heart, and the body was burned. This, if Southey's
authorities (J. B. Boyer, Marquis d'Argens, in <i>Lettres Juives</i>) may
be believed, "laid" the vampire, and the community might sleep
in peace. (See, too, <i>Dissertations sur les Apparitions</i>, par Augustine
Calmet, 1746, p. 395, <i>sq</i>., and <i>Russian Folk-Tales</i>, by W. R. S.

put by the fisherman, the narrator of the first part of the <i>Fragment</i>,

has been pleased to "abide" during the past six years, under conditions
and after a fashion of which the monk disapproves. Hereupon
the fisherman disappears, and a kind of dialogue between the

that I look on the skulls which stand beside me (I have always had
four in my study) without emotion, but I cannot strip the features of
those I have known of their fleshy covering, even in idea, without

downright second-sight in the East) fell once under my own observation.
On my third journey to Cape Colonna, early in 1811, as
we passed through the defile that leads from the hamlet between
Keratia and Colonna, I observed Dervish Tahiri riding rather out
of the path and leaning his head upon his hand, as if in pain. I
rode up and inquired. "We are in peril," he answered. "What
peril? We are not now in Albania, nor in the passes to Ephesus,
Messalunghi, or Lepanto; there are plenty of us, well armed, and
the Choriates have not courage to be thieves."&mdash;"True, Affendi,
but nevertheless the shot is ringing in my ears."&mdash;"The shot. Not a
tophaike has been fired this morning."&mdash;"I hear it
notwithstanding&mdash;Bom&mdash;Bom&mdash;as
plainly as I hear your voice."&mdash;"Psha!"&mdash;"As
you please, Affendi; if it is written, so will it be."&mdash;I left
this quick-eared predestinarian, and rode up to Basili, his Christian
compatriot, whose ears, though not at all prophetic, by no means
relished the intelligence. We all arrived at Colonna, remained
some hours, and returned leisurely, saying a variety of brilliant
things, in more languages than spoiled the building of Babel, upon
the mistaken seer. Romaic, Arnaout, Turkish, Italian, and English
were all exercised, in various conceits, upon the unfortunate Mussulman.
While we were contemplating the beautiful prospect, Dervish
was occupied about the columns. I thought he was deranged into
an antiquarian, and asked him if he had become a "<i>Palaocastro</i>"
man? "No," said he; "but these pillars will be useful in making
a stand;" and added other remarks, which at least evinced his own
belief in his troublesome faculty of <i>forehearing</i>. On our return to
Athens we heard from Leon&eacute; (a prisoner set ashore some days after)
of the intended attack of the Mainotes, mentioned, with the cause of
its not taking place, in the notes to <i>Childe Harold</i>, Canto 2nd
[<i>Poetical Works</i>, 1899, ii. 169]. I was at some pains to question the
man, and he described the dresses, arms, and marks of the horses of
our party so accurately, that, with other circumstances, we could
not doubt of <i>his</i> having been in "villanous company"
[I <i>Henry IV</i>., act iii. sc. 3, line 11] and ourselves in
a bad neighbourhood.
Dervish became a soothsayer for life, and I dare say is now hearing
more musketry than ever will be fired, to the great refreshment of
the Arnaouts of Berat, and his native mountains.&mdash;I shall mention
one trait more of this singular race. In March, 1811, a remarkably
stout and active Arnaout came (I believe the fiftieth on the same
errand) to offer himself as an attendant, which was declined.
"Well, Affendi," quoth he, "may you live!&mdash;you would have
found me useful. I shall leave the town for the hills to-morrow;
in the winter I return, perhaps you will then receive me."&mdash;Dervish,
who was present, remarked as a thing of course, and of no consequence,
"in the mean time he will join the Klephtes" (robbers),
which was true to the letter. If not cut off, they come down in the
winter, and pass it unmolested in some town, where they are often
as well known as their exploits.</p></div>

uncommon in Turkey. A few years ago the wife of Muchtar Pacha
complained to his father of his son's supposed infidelity; he asked
with whom, and she had the barbarity to give in a list of the twelve
handsomest women in Yanina. They were seized, fastened up in
sacks, and drowned in the lake the same night! One of the guards
who was present informed me that not one of the victims uttered a
cry, or showed a symptom of terror at so sudden a "wrench from all
we know, from all we love." The fate of Phrosine, the fairest of
this sacrifice, is the subject of many a Romaic and Arnaout ditty.
The story in the text is one told of a young Venetian many years
ago, and now nearly forgotten. I heard it by accident recited by
one of the coffee-house story-tellers who abound in the Levant, and
sing or recite their narratives. The additions and interpolations by
the translator will be easily distinguished from the rest, by the want
of Eastern imagery; and I regret that my memory has retained so
few fragments of the original. For the contents of some of the notes
I am indebted partly to D'Herbelot, and partly to that most Eastern,
and, as Mr. Weber justly entitles it, "sublime tale," the "Caliph
Vathek." I do not know from what source the author of that singular
volume may have drawn his materials; some of his incidents are
to be found in the <i>Biblioth&egrave;que Orientale</i>; but for correctness of
costume, beauty of description, and power of imagination, it far surpasses
all European imitations, and bears such marks of originality
that those who have visited the East will find some difficulty in
believing it to be more than a translation. As an Eastern tale, even
Rasselas must bow before it; his "Happy Valley" will not bear a
comparison with the "Hall of Eblis." [See <i>Childe Harold</i>, Canto II.
stanza xxii. line 6, <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1899, ii. 37, note 1.

</p><p>
"Mansour Effendi tells the story (<i>vide supra</i>, line 6) thus:
Frosini was niece of the Archbishop of Joannina. Mouctar Pasha
ordered her to come to his harem, and her father advised her to
go; she did so. Mouctar, among other presents, gave her a ring
of great value, which she wished to sell, and gave it for that purpose
to a merchant, who offered it to the wife of Mouctar. That
lady recognized the jewel as her own, and, discovering the intrigue,
complained to Ali Pasha, who, the next night, seized her himself
in his own house, and ordered her to be drowned. Mansour
Effendi says he had the story from the brother and son of Frosini.
This son was a child of six years old, and was in bed in his
mother's chamber when Ali came to carry away his mother to death.
He had a confused recollection of the horrid scene."&mdash;<i>Travels in
Albania,</i> 1858, i. Ill, note 6.
</p><p>
The concluding note, like the poem, was built up sentence by
sentence. Lines 1-12, "forgotten," are in the MS. Line 12,
"I heard," to line 17, "original," were added in the Second Edition.
The next sentence, "For the contents" to "Vathek," was inserted
in the Third; and the concluding paragraph, "I do not know" to
the end, in the Fourth Editions.]</p></div>

INTRODUCTION TO THE <i>THE BRIDE OF ABYDOS</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> poets&mdash;Wordsworth, for instance&mdash;have been conscious
in their old age that an interest attaches to the circumstances
of the composition of their poems, and have furnished
their friends and admirers with explanatory notes. Byron
recorded the <i>motif</i> and occasion of the <i>Bride of Abydos</i>
while the poem was still in the press. It was written, he
says, to divert his mind, "to wring his thoughts from reality
to imagination&mdash;from selfish regrets to vivid recollections"
(<i>Diary</i>, December 5, 1813, <i>Letters</i>, ii. 361), "to distract his
dreams from ..." (<i>Diary</i>, November 16) "for the sake of

<i>employment</i>" (Letter to Moore, November 30, 1813). He
had been staying during part of October and November at
Aston Hall, Rotherham, with his friend James Wedderburn
Webster, and had fallen in love with his friend's wife, Lady
Frances. From a brief note to his sister, dated November 5,
we learn that he was in a scrape, but in "no immediate peril,"
and from the lines, "Remember him, whom Passion's power"
(<i>vide ante</i>, <a href="#Page_67">p. 67</a>), we may infer that he had sought
safety in flight. The <i>Bride of Abydos</i>, or <i>Zuleika</i>, as it was
first entitled, was written early in November, "in four nights"
(<i>Diary</i>, November 16), or in a week (Letter to
Gifford, November 12)&mdash;the reckoning goes for little&mdash;as
a counter-irritant to the pain and distress of <i>amour interrompu</i>.</p>

<p>The confession or apology is eminently characteristic.
Whilst the <i>Giaour</i> was still in process of evolution, still
"lengthening its rattles," another Turkish poem is offered to
the public, and the natural explanation, that the author is
in vein, and can score another trick, is felt to be inadequate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
and dishonouring&mdash;"To withdraw <i>myself</i> from <i>myself</i>," he
confides to his <i>Diary</i>(November 27), "has ever been my
sole, my entire, my sincere motive for scribbling at all."</p>

<p>It is more than probable that in his twenty-sixth year
Byron had not attained to perfect self-knowledge, but there
is no reason to question his sincerity. That Byron loved to
surround himself with mystery, and to dissociate himself
from "the general," is true enough; but it does not follow
that at all times and under all circumstances he was insincere.
"Once a <i>poseur</i> always a <i>poseur</i>" is a rough-and-ready
formula not invariably applicable even to a poet.</p>

<p>But the <i>Bride of Abydos</i> was a tonic as well as a styptic.
Like the <i>Giaour</i>, it embodied a personal experience, and
recalled "a country replete with the <i>darkest</i> and <i>brightest</i>,
but always the most <i>lively</i> colours of my memory" (<i>Diary</i>,
December 5, 1813).</p>

<p>In a letter to Galt (December 11, 1813, Letters, 1898,
ii. 304, reprinted from <i>Life of Byron</i>, pp. 181, 182) Byron
maintains that the first part of the <i>Bride</i> was drawn from
"observations" of his own, "from existence." He had, it
would appear, intended to make the story turn on the guilty
love of a brother for a sister, a tragic incident of life in a
Harem, which had come under his notice during his travels
in the East, but "on second thoughts" had reflected that
he lived "two centuries at least too late for the subject,"
and that not even the authority of the "finest works of the
Greeks," or of Schiller (in the <i>Bride of Messina</i>), or of Alfieri
(in <i>Mirra</i>), "in modern times," would sanction the intrusion
of the
<span title="mis&ecirc;to\n">&#956;&#953;&#963;&#951;&#964;&#8056;&#957;</span>
into English literature. The early drafts and
variants of the MS. do not afford any evidence of this
alteration of the plot which, as Byron thought, was detrimental
to the poem as a work of art, but the undoubted
fact that the <i>Bride of Abydos</i>, as well as the <i>Giaour</i>, embody
recollections of actual scenes and incidents which had burnt
themselves into the memory of an eye-witness, accounts not
only for the fervent heat at which these Turkish tales were
written, but for the extraordinary glamour which they threw
over contemporary readers, to whom the local colouring
was new and attractive, and who were not out of conceit
with "good Monsieur Melancholy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Byron was less dissatisfied with his second Turkish tale
than he had been with the <i>Giaour</i>. He apologizes for the
rapidity with which it had been composed&mdash;<i>stans pede in uno</i>&mdash;but
he announced to Murray (November 20) that
"he was doing his best to beat the <i>Giaour</i>," and (November 29)
he appraises the <i>Bride</i> as "my first entire composition of
any length."</p>

<p>Moreover, he records (November 15), with evident gratification,
the approval of his friend Hodgson, "a very sincere
and by no means (at times) a flattering critic of mine," and
modestly accepts the praise of such masters of letters as
"Mr. Canning," Hookham Frere, Heber, Lord Holland, and
of the traveller Edward Daniel Clarke.</p>

<p>The <i>Bride of Abydos</i> was advertised in the <i>Morning
Chronicle,</i> among "Books published this day," on November
29, 1813. It was reviewed by George Agar Ellis in the

<i>Quarterly Review</i> of January, 1814 (vol. x. p. 331), and,
together with the <i>Corsair</i>, by Jeffrey in the
<i>Edinburgh Review</i> of April, 1814 (vol. xxiii. p. 198).</p>

NOTE TO <i>THE BRIDE OF ABYDOS</i>.

<h3>CANTO II. STANZA XX.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the completion of the fair copy of the MS. of the
<i>Bride of Abydos</i>, seventy lines were added to stanza xx. of
Canto II. In both MSS. the rough and fair copies, the
stanza ends with the line, "The Dove of peace and promise
to mine ark!"</p>

<p>Seven MS. sheets are extant, which make up the greater
portion of these additional lines.</p>

<p>The <i>First Addition</i> amounts to eight lines, and takes the
narrative from line 880 to line 893, "Wait&mdash;wave&mdash;defend&mdash;
destroy&mdash;at thy command!"</p>

<p>Lines 884-889 do not appear in the first MS. Fragment,
but are given in three variants on separate sheets. Two of
these are dated December 2 and December 3, 1813.</p>

<p>The <i>Second Fragment</i> begins with line 890, "For thee in
those bright isles is built a bower," and, numbering twenty-two
lines, ends with a variant of line 907, "Blend every
thought, do all&mdash;but disunite!" Two lines of this addition,
"With thee all toils are sweet," find a place in the text as
lines 934, 935.</p>

<p>The <i>Third Fragment</i> amounts to thirty-six lines, and
may be taken as the first draft of the whole additions&mdash;lines 880-949.</p>

<p>Lines 908-925 and 936-945 of the text are still later
additions, but a fourth MS. fragment supplies lines 920-925
and lines 936-945. (A fair copy of this fragment gives text
for Revise of November 13.) Between November 13 and
November 25 no less than ten revises of the <i>Bride</i> were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
submitted to Lord Byron. In the earliest of these, dated
November 13, the thirty-six lines of the Third Fragment have
been expanded into forty lines&mdash;four lines of the MS. being
omitted, and twelve lines, 908-919, "Once free,"&mdash;"social
home," being inserted. The text passed through five revises
and remained unaltered till November 21, when eighteen
lines were added to the forty, viz.: (4) "Mark! where his
carnage,"&mdash;"sabre's length;" (6) "There ev'n thy soul,"&mdash;"Zuleika's
name;" and (8) "Aye&mdash;let the loud winds,"&mdash;"bars
escape." Of these the two latter additions belong to
the <i>Fourth Fragment</i>. The text in this state passed through
three more revises, but before the first edition was issued
two more lines were added&mdash;lines 938, 939,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The deepest murmur of this lip shall be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sigh for safety, but a prayer for thee!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Even then the six lines, "Blest&mdash;as the Muezzin's,"&mdash;"endears,"
are wanting in the text; but the four lines, "Soft&mdash;as
the melody,"&mdash;"endears," are inserted in MS. in the
margin. The text as it stands first appears in the Seventh
Edition.</p>

called the <i>Bride</i> of Abydos? It is a cursed awkward question,
being unanswerable. <i>She</i> is not a <i>bride</i>, only about to become one.

Byron need not have been dismayed. "The term is particularly
applied on the day of marriage and during the 'honeymoon,' but is
frequently used from the proclamation of the banns.... In the
debate on Prince Leopold's allowance, Mr. Gladstone, being
criticized for speaking of the Princess Helena as the 'bride,' said he
believed that colloquially a lady when engaged was often called a
'bride.' This was met with 'Hear! Hear!' from some, and 'No!
No!' from others."&mdash;<i>N. Engl. Dict</i>., art. "Bride."]</p></div>

"Him who hath not Music in his soul," but merely request the
reader to recollect, for ten seconds, the features of the woman whom
he believes to be the most beautiful; and, if he then does not comprehend
fully what is feebly expressed in the above line, I shall be
sorry for us both. For an eloquent passage in the latest work of the
first female writer of this, perhaps of any, age, on the analogy (and
the immediate comparison excited by that analogy) between "painting
and music," see vol. iii. cap. 10, <span class="smcap">De l'Allemagne</span>. And is
not this connection still stronger with the original than the copy?
with the colouring of Nature than of Art? After all, this is rather
to be felt than described; still I think there are some who will
understand it, at least they would have done had they beheld the
countenance whose speaking harmony suggested the idea; for this
passage is not drawn from imagination but memory,[A] that mirror
which Affliction dashes to the earth, and looking down upon the
fragments, only beholds the reflection multiplied!
</p><p>

[A] <i>In this line I have not drawn from fiction but memory&mdash;that
mirror of regret memory&mdash;the too faithful mirror of affliction the
long vista through which we gaze. Someone has said that the perfection
of Architecture is frozen music&mdash;the perfection of Beauty to my
mind always presented the idea of living Music</i>.&mdash;[MS. erased.]
</p><p>
[For the simile of the broken mirror, compare <i>Childe Harold</i>,
Canto III. stanza xxxiii. line 1 (<i>Poetical Works</i>, ii. 236, note 2);
and for "the expression," "music breathing from her face," compare
Sir Thomas Browne's <i>Religio Medici</i>, Part II. sect, ix., <i>Works</i>,
1835, ii. 106, "And sure there is musick, even in the beauty and
the silent note which Cupid strikes, far sweeter than the sound of
any instrument;" and Lovelace's "Song," <i>Orpheus to Beasts</i>&mdash;

<p>
The effect of the appeal to Madame de Sta&euml;l is thus recorded in
Byron's <i>Journal</i> of December 7, 1813 (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 369):
"This morning, a very pretty billet from the Sta&euml;l," (for passage in

<i>De L'Allemagne</i>, Part III. chap, x., and the "billet,"
see <i>Letters,</i> ii. 354, note 1) ... "She has been pleased to
be pleased with my slight eulogy in the note annexed
to <i>The Bride</i>."]

is the principal landholder in Turkey;
he governs Magnesia: those who, by a kind of
feudal tenure, possess land on condition of service, are called Timariots:
they serve as Spahis, according to the extent of territory,
and bring a certain number into the field, generally cavalry.
</p><p>
[The "line of Carasman" dates back to Kara Youlouk, the
founder of the dynasty of the "White Sheep," at the close of the
fourteenth century. Hammer-Purgstall (<i>Hist. de l'Emp. Ottoman</i>,
iii. 151) gives <i>sang-sue</i>, "blood-sucker,"
as the equivalent of Youlouk,
which should, however, be interpreted "smooth-face."
Of the Magnesian Kara Osman Oglou ("Black Osman-son"), Dallaway
(<i>Constantinople Ancient and Modern</i>, 1797, p. 190) writes,
"He is the most powerful and opulent der&egrave; bey ('lord of the valley'), or
feudal tenant, in the empire, and, though inferior to the pashas in
rank, possesses more wealth and influence, and offers them an
example of administration and patriotic government which they
have rarely the virtue to follow." For the Timariots, who formed
the third class of the feudal cavalry of the Ottoman Empire, see
Finlay's <i>Greece under Othoman ... Domination</i>, 1856, pp. 50, 51.]</p></div>

contrary, he is weak or loyal, he bows, kisses the Sultan's respectable
signature, and is bowstrung with great complacency. In 1810,
several of these presents were exhibited in the niche of the Seraglio

his life, set the whole power of the Porte at defiance.
</p><p>
[Passwan Oglou (1758-1807) [Passewend's, or the Watchman's
son, according to Hobhouse] was born and died at Widdin. He
first came into notice in 1788, in alliance with certain disbanded
Turkish levies, named <i>Krdschalies</i>. "It was their pride to ride
along on stately horses, with trappings of gold and silver, and
bearing costly arms. In their train were female slaves, Giuvendi,
in male attire, who not only served to amuse them in their hours of
ease with singing and dancing, but also followed them to battle (as
Kaled followed Lara, see <i>Lara</i>, Canto II. stanza xv., etc.),
for the purpose of holding their horses when they fought." On one occasion
he is reported to have addressed these "rebel hordes" much in the
spirit of the "Corsair," "The booty be yours, and mine the glory."
"After having for some time suffered a Pacha to be associated with
him, he at length expelled his superior, and demanded 'the three
horse-tails' for himself." In 1798 the Porte despatched another army,
but Passwan was completely victorious, and "at length the Porte
resolved to make peace, and actually sent him the 'three horse-tails'"
(i.e. made him commander-in-chief of the Janissaries at Widdin).

belief of the Duchess of Kendal, that George I. flew into her window
in the shape of a raven (see <i>Orford's Reminiscences, Lord Orford's
Works</i>, 1798, iv. 283), and many other instances, bring this superstition
nearer home. The most singular was the whim of a Worcester
lady, who, believing her daughter to exist in the shape of a
singing bird, literally furnished her pew in the cathedral with cages
full of the kind; and as she was rich, and a benefactress in beautifying
the church, no objection was made to her harmless folly. For
this anecdote, see <i>Orford's Letters</i>.

["But here (at Gloucester) is a <i>modernity</i>,
which beats all antiquities
for curiosity. Just by the high altar is a small pew hung
with green damask, with curtains of the same; a small corner-cupboard,
painted, carved, and gilt, for books, in one corner, and two
troughs of a bird-cage, with seeds and water. If any mayoress on
earth was small enough to inclose herself in this tabernacle, or
abstemious enough to feed on rape and canary, I should have sworn
that it was the shrine of the queen of the aldermen. It belongs to
a Mrs. Cotton, who, having lost a favourite daughter, is convinced
her soul is transmigrated into a robin redbreast, for which reason
she passes her life in making an aviary of the cathedral of
Gloucester."&mdash;Letter to Richard Bentley, September, 1753

INTRODUCTION TO <i>THE CORSAIR</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>

</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A seventh</span> edition of the <i>Giaour</i>, including the final
additions, and the first edition of the <i>Bride of Abydos</i>, were
published on the twenty-ninth of November, 1813. In less
than three weeks (December 18) Byron began the <i>Corsair</i>,
and completed the fair copy of the first draft by the last day
of the year. The <i>Corsair</i> in all but its final shape, together
with the sixth edition of the <i>Bride of Abydos</i>, the seventh of
<i>Childe Harold</i>, and the ninth of the <i>Giaour</i>, was issued on
the first of February, 1814.</p>

<p>A letter from John Murray to Lord Byron, dated February
3, 1814 (<i>Memoir of John Murray</i>, 1891, i. 223), presents a
vivid picture of a great literary triumph&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;I have been unwilling to write until I had
something to say.... I am most happy to tell you that
your last poem <i>is</i>&mdash;what Mr. Southey's is <i>called</i>&mdash;a
<i>Carmen Triumphale</i>. Never in my recollection has any work ...
excited such a ferment ... I sold on the day of publication&mdash;a
thing perfectly unprecedented&mdash;10,000 copies.... Mr.
Moore says it is masterly&mdash;a wonderful performance. Mr.
Hammond, Mr. Heber, D'Israeli, every one who comes ...
declare their unlimited approbation. Mr. Ward was here
with Mr. Gifford yesterday, and mingled his admiration with
the rest ... and Gifford did, what I never knew him do
before&mdash;he repeated several stanzas from memory, particularly
the closing stanza&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'His death yet dubious, deeds too widely known.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I have the highest encomiums in letters from Croker and
Mr. Hay; but I rest most upon the warm feeling it has
created in Gifford's critic heart.... You have no notion of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
the sensation which the publication has occasioned; and
my only regret is that you were not present to witness it."</p></blockquote>

<p>For some time before and after the poem appeared,
Byron was, as he told Leigh Hunt (February 9, 1814;
<i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 27), "snow-bound and thaw-swamped in
'the valley of the shadow' of Newstead Abbey," and it was
not till he had returned to town that he resumed his journal,
and bethought him of placing on record some dark sayings
with regard to the story of the <i>Corsair</i> and the personality
of Conrad. Under date February 18, 1814, he writes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The <i>Corsair</i> has been conceived, written, published,
etc., since I last took up this journal [?last day but one].
They tell me it has great success; it was written <i>con amore</i>
[i.e. during the reign of Lady Frances Wedderburn Webster],
and much from <i>existence</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>And again, <i>Journal</i>, March 10 (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 399),</p>

<blockquote><p>"He [Hobhouse] told me an odd report,&mdash;that <i>I</i> am the
actual Conrad, the veritable Corsair, and that part of my
travels are supposed to have passed in privacy [<i>sic;</i>?piracy].
Um! people sometimes hit near the truth; but never the
whole truth. H. don't know what I was about the year
after he left the Levant; nor does any one&mdash;nor&mdash;nor&mdash;nor&mdash;however,
it is a lie&mdash;but, 'I doubt the equivocation of the
fiend that lies like truth.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>Very little weight can be attached to these "I could an
I would" pronouncements, deliberately framed to provoke
curiosity, and destined, no doubt, sooner or later to see the
light; but the fact remains that Conrad is not a mere presentation
of Byron in a fresh disguise, or "The Pirate's
Tale" altogether a "painting of the imagination."</p>

<p>That the <i>Corsair</i> is founded upon fact is argued at some
length by the author (an "English Gentleman in the Greek
Military Service") of the <i>Life, Writings, Opinions, and
Times of the R. H. George Gordon Noel Byron</i>, which was
published in 1825. The point of the story (i. 197-201), which
need not be repeated at length, is that Byron, on leaving
Constantinople and reaching the island of Zea (July, 1810),
visited ["strolled about"] the islands of the Archipelago,
in company with a Venetian gentleman who had turned
buccaneer <i>malgr&eacute; lui</i>, and whose history and adventures,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
amatory and piratical, prefigured and inspired the "gestes"
of Conrad. The tale must be taken for what it is worth;
but it is to be remarked that it affords a clue to Byron's
mysterious entries in a journal which did not see the
light till 1830, five years after the "English Gentleman"
published his volumes of gossiping anecdote. It may, too,
be noted that, although, in his correspondence of 1810, 1811,
there is no mention of any tour among the "Isles of Greece,"
in a letter to Moore dated February 2, 1815 (<i>Letters</i>, 1899,
iii. 176), Byron recalls "the interesting white squalls and
short seas of Archipelago memory."</p>

<p>How far Byron may have drawn on personal experience
for his picture of a pirate <i>chez lui</i>, it is impossible to say;
but during the year 1809-11, when he was travelling in
Greece, the exploits of Lambros Katzones and other Greek
pirates sailing under the Russian flag must have been within
the remembrance and on the lips of the islanders and the
"patriots" of the mainland. The "Pirate's Island," from
which "Ariadne's isle" (line 444) was visible, may be intended
for Paros or Anti-Paros.</p>

<p>For the inception of Conrad (see Canto I. stanza ii.), the
paradoxical hero, an assortment rather than an amalgam of
incongruous characteristics, Byron may, perhaps, have been in
some measure indebted to the description of Malefort, junior,
in Massinger's <i>Unnatural Combat</i>, act i. sc. 2, line 20, sq.&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I have sat with him in his cabin a day together,<br /></span>
<hr />
<span class="i0">Sigh he did often, as if inward grief<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And melancholy at that instant would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Choke up his vital spirits....<br /></span>
<span class="i13">When from the maintop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sail's descried, all thoughts that do concern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself laid by, no lion pinched with hunger<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then he comes on the deck; and then how wisely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gives directions," etc.<br /></span>

<p>The <i>Corsair</i>, together with the <i>Bride of Abydos</i>, was
reviewed by Jeffrey in the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> of April, 1814,
vol. xxiii. p. 198; and together with <i>Lara</i>, by George Agar
Ellis in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> of July, 1814, vol. ii. p. 428.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> comparison with the <i>Giaour</i>, the additions made to the
<i>Corsair</i> whilst it was passing through the press were inconsiderable.
The original MS., which numbers 1737 lines, is
probably the fair copy of a number of loose sheets which
have not been preserved. The erasures are few and far
between, and the variations between the copy and the text
are neither numerous nor important.</p>

<p>In one of the latest revises stanza x. was added to the
First Canto. The last four lines of stanza xi. first appeared
in the Seventh Edition.</p>

<p>The Second Canto suffered no alteration except the substitution
of lines 1131-1133 for two lines which were expunged.</p>

<p>Larger additions were made to the Third Canto. Lines
1299-1375, or stanza v. (included in a revise dated January
6, 1814), stanzas xvii. and xxiii., numbering respectively 77,
32, and 16 lines, and the two last lines of stanza x., 127 lines
in all, represent the difference between the text as it now
stands and the original MS.</p>

<p>In a note to Byron's <i>Poetical Works</i>, 1832, ix. 257, it is
stated that the <i>Corsair</i> was begun on the 18th and finished
on the 31st of December, 1813. In the Introduction to the
<i>Corsair</i> prefixed to the Library Edition, the poem is said to
have been composed in ten days, "at the rate of 200 lines a
day." The first page of the MS. is dated "27th of December,
1813," and the last page "December 31, 1813, January 1,
1814." It is probable that the composition of the first draft
was begun on the 18th and finished on the 27th of December,
and that the work of transcription occupied the last five days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>

of the month. Stanza v. of Canto III. reached the publisher
on the 6th, and stanzas xvii. and xxiii. on the 11th and
12th of January, 1814.</p>

<p>The First Edition amounted to 1859 lines (the numeration,
owing to the inclusion of broken lines, is given as 1863), and
falls short of the existing text by the last four lines of stanza
xi. It contains the first dedication to Moore, and numbers
100 pages. To the Second Edition, which numbers 108 pages,
the following poems were appended:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>To a Lady Weeping</i>.</p>

<p><i>From the Turkish</i>.</p>

<p><i>Sonnet to Genevra</i> ("Thine eyes' blue tenderness," etc.).</p>

<p><i>Sonnet to Genevra</i> ("Thy cheek is pale with thought," etc.).</p>

<p><i>Inscription on the Monument of a Newfoundland Dog</i>.</p>

<p><i>Farewell</i>.</p>

<p>These occasional poems were not appended to the Third
Edition, which only numbered 100 pages; but they reappeared
in the Fourth and subsequent editions.</p>

<p>The Seventh Edition contained four additional lines (the
last four of stanza xi.), and a note (unnumbered) to line 226,
in defence of the <i>vraisemblance</i> of the <i>Corsair's</i>
misanthropy. The Ninth Edition numbered 112 pages. The
additional matter consists of a long note to the last line of
the poem ("Linked with one virtue, and a thousand crimes")
on the pirates of Barataria.</p>

<p>Twenty-five thousand copies of the <i>Corsair</i> were sold
between January and March, 1814. An Eighth Edition of
fifteen hundred copies was printed in March, and sold before
the end of the year. A Ninth Edition of three thousand
copies was printed in the beginning of 1815.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<h3><a name="TO_ESQ" id="TO_ESQ"></a>TO THOMAS MOORE, ESQ.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Moore</span>,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I dedicate</span> to you the last production with which I
shall trespass on public patience, and your indulgence, for
some years; and I own that I feel anxious to avail myself of
this latest and only opportunity of adorning my pages with a
name, consecrated by unshaken public principle, and the
most undoubted and various talents. While Ireland ranks
you among the firmest of her patriots; while you stand alone
the first of her bards in her estimation, and Britain repeats
and ratifies the decree, permit one, whose only regret, since
our first acquaintance, has been the years he had lost before
it commenced, to add the humble but sincere suffrage of
friendship, to the voice of more than one nation. It will at
least prove to you, that I have neither forgotten the gratification
derived from your society, nor abandoned the prospect
of its renewal, whenever your leisure or inclination allows
you to atone to your friends for too long an absence. It is
said among those friends, I trust truly, that you are engaged
in the composition of a poem whose scene will be laid in
the East; none can do those scenes so much justice. The
wrongs of your own country,<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> the magnificent and fiery spirit<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
of her sons, the beauty and feeling of her daughters, may
there be found; and Collins, when he denominated his
Oriental his Irish Eclogues, was not aware how true, at least,
was a part of his parallel. Your imagination will create a
warmer sun, and less clouded sky; but wildness, tenderness,
and originality, are part of your national claim of oriental
descent, to which you have already thus far proved your
title more clearly than the most zealous of your country's
antiquarians.</p>

<p>May I add a few words on a subject on which all men are
supposed to be fluent, and none agreeable?&mdash;Self. I have
written much, and published more than enough to demand a
longer silence than I now meditate; but, for some years to
come, it is my intention to tempt no further the award of
"Gods, men, nor columns." In the present composition I
have attempted not the most difficult, but, perhaps, the best
adapted measure to our language, the good old and now
neglected heroic couplet. The stanza of Spenser is perhaps
too slow and dignified for narrative; though, I confess, it is
the measure most after my own heart; Scott alone,<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> of the
present generation, has hitherto completely triumphed over
the fatal facility of the octosyllabic verse; and this is not the
least victory of his fertile and mighty genius: in blank verse,
Milton, Thomson, and our dramatists, are the beacons that
shine along the deep, but warn us from the rough and barren
rock on which they are kindled. The heroic couplet is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the most popular measure certainly; but as I did not deviate
into the other from a wish to flatter what is called public
opinion, I shall quit it without further apology, and take my
chance once more with that versification, in which I have
hitherto published nothing but compositions whose former circulation
is part of my present, and will be of my future regret.</p>

<p>With regard to my story, and stories in general, I should
have been glad to have rendered my personages more perfect
and amiable, if possible, inasmuch as I have been sometimes
criticised, and considered no less responsible for their
deeds and qualities than if all had been personal. Be it so&mdash;if
I have deviated into the gloomy vanity of "drawing
from self," the pictures are probably like, since they are
unfavourable: and if not, those who know me are undeceived,
and those who do not, I have little interest in undeceiving.
I have no particular desire that any but my
acquaintance should think the author better than the beings
of his imagining; but I cannot help a little surprise, and
perhaps amusement, at some odd critical exceptions in the
present instance, when I see several bards (far more deserving,
I allow) in very reputable plight, and quite exempted
from all participation in the faults of those heroes, who, nevertheless,
might be found with little more morality than
<i>The Giaour</i>, and perhaps&mdash;but no&mdash;I must admit Childe Harold
to be a very repulsive personage; and as to his identity, those
who like it must give him whatever "alias" they please.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>
<p>If, however, it were worth while to remove the impression,
it might be of some service to me, that the man who is alike
the delight of his readers and his friends, the poet of all
circles, and the idol of his own, permits me here and elsewhere
to subscribe myself,</p>

"Eccelin, prisonnier," dit Rolandini, "s'enfermoit dans un silence
mena&ccedil;ant; il fixoit sur la terre son visage f&eacute;roce, et ne donnoit point
d'essor &agrave; sa profonde indignation. De toutes partes cependant les
soldats et les peuples accouroient; ils vouloient voir cet homme,
jadis si puissant ... et la joie universelle &eacute;clatoit de toutes partes....
Eccelino &eacute;toit d'une petite taille; mais tout l'aspect de sa
personne, tous ses mouvemens, indiquoient un soldat. Son langage

&eacute;toit amer, son d&eacute;portement superbe, et par son seul regard, il
faisoit trembler les plus hardis."&mdash;Simonde de Sismondi, <i>Histoire
des R&eacute;publiques Italiennes du Moyen Age</i>, 1809, iii. 219.

to visit Carthage in the character of his own ambassador; and
Genseric was afterwards mortified by the discovery, that he had

"lumbering Goth" (see John Bull's Letter), A. A. Watts, in the

<i>Literary Gazette</i>, February and March, 1821&mdash;among his supposed
plagiarisms. Sotheby informed Moore that his lines had been
written, though not published, before the appearance of the <i>Corsair</i>.
The <i>Confession</i>, and <i>Orestes</i>, reappeared with three hitherto
unpublished tragedies, <i>Ivan</i>, <i>The Death of Darnley</i>,
and <i>Zamorin and Zama</i>,
under the general title, <i>Five Unpublished Tragedies</i>, in 1814.

</p><p>
The story of the critic John Dennis (1657-1734) and the
"thunder" is related in Cibber's <i>Lives</i>, iv. 234. Dennis was, or
feigned to be, the inventor of a new method of producing stage-thunder,
by troughs of wood and stops. Shortly after a play
(<i>Appius and Virginia</i>) which he had put upon the stage had been
withdrawn, he was present at a performance of <i>Macbeth</i>, at which
the new "thunder" was inaugurated. "That is <i>my</i> thunder, by
God!" exclaimed Dennis. "The villains will play my thunder, but
not my plays."&mdash;<i>Dict. Nat. Biog.</i>, art. "Dennis."]</p></div>

which is represented in one instance
of Conrad's character has not been carried beyond the bounds of
probability, may perhaps be in some degree confirmed by the following
anecdote of a brother buccaneer in the year 1814:&mdash;"Our
readers have all seen the account of the enterprise against the pirates
of Barataria; but few, we believe, were informed of the situation,
history, or nature of that establishment. For the information of
such as were unacquainted with it, we have procured from a friend
the following interesting narrative of the main facts, of which he has
personal knowledge, and which cannot fail to interest some of our
readers:&mdash;Barataria is a bayou, or a narrow arm of the Gulf of
Mexico; it runs through a rich but very flat country, until it reaches
within a mile of the Mississippi river, fifteen miles below the city of
New Orleans. This bayou has branches almost innumerable, in
which persons can lie concealed from the severest scrutiny. It communicates
with three lakes which lie on the south-west side, and these,
with the lake of the same name, and which lies contiguous to the
sea, where there is an island formed by the two arms of this lake
and the sea. The east and west points of this island were fortified,
in the year 1811, by a band of pirates, under the command of one
Monsieur La Fitte. A large majority of these outlaws are of that
class of the population of the state of Louisiana who fled from the
island of St. Domingo during the troubles there, and took refuge in
the island of Cuba; and when the last war between France and
Spain commenced, they were compelled to leave that island with
the short notice of a few days. Without ceremony they entered the
United States, the most of them the state of Louisiana, with all
the negroes they had possessed in Cuba. They were notified by the
Governor of that State of the clause in the constitution which
forbade the importation of slaves; but, at the same time, received
the assurance of the Governor that he would obtain, if possible, the
approbation of the General Government for their retaining this
property.&mdash;The island of Barataria is situated about lat. 29 deg. 15 min.,
lon. 92. 30.; and is as remarkable for its health as for the superior
scale and shell fish with which its waters abound. The chief of this
horde, like Charles de Moor, had, mixed with his many vices, some
transcendant virtues. In the year 1813, this party had, from its turpitude
and boldness, claimed the attention of the Governor of Louisiana;
and to break up the establishment he thought proper to strike
at the head. He therefore, offered a reward of 500 dollars for the
head of Monsieur La Fitte, who was well known to the inhabitants
of the city of New Orleans, from his immediate connection, and his
once having been a fencing-master in that city of great reputation,
which art he learnt in Buonaparte's army, where he was a captain.
The reward which was offered by the Governor for the head of La
Fitte was answered by the offer of a reward from the latter of 15,000
for the head of the Governor. The Governor ordered out a company
to march from the city to La Fitte's island, and to burn and destroy
all the property, and to bring to the city of New Orleans all his
banditti. This company, under the command of a man who had
been the intimate associate of this bold Captain, approached very
near to the fortified island, before he saw a man, or heard a sound,
until he heard a whistle, not unlike a boatswain's call. Then it was
he found himself surrounded by armed men who had emerged from
the secret avenues which led to this bayou. Here it was that this
modern Charles de Moor developed his few noble traits; for to this
man, who had come to destroy his life and all that was dear to him,
he not only spared his life, but offered him that which would have
made the honest soldier easy for the remainder of his days, which
was indignantly refused. He then, with the approbation of his
captor, returned to the city. This circumstance, and some concomitant
events, proved that this band of pirates was not to be taken by
land. Our naval force having always been small in that quarter,
exertions for the destruction of this illicit establishment could not be
expected from them until augmented; for an officer of the navy,
with most of the gun-boats on that station, had to retreat from an
overwhelming force of La Fitte's. So soon as the augmentation of
the navy authorised an attack, one was made; the overthrow of this
banditti has been the result: and now this almost invulnerable point
and key to New Orleans is clear of an enemy, it is to be hoped the
government will hold it by a strong military force."&mdash;American
Newspaper.
</p><p>
[The story of the "Pirates of Barataria," which an American
print, the <i>National Intelligencer</i>, was the first to make public, is
quoted <i>in extenso</i> by the <i>Weekly Messenger</i>

(published at Boston) of
November 4, 1814. It is remarkable that a tale which was destined
to pass into the domain of historical romance should have been
instantly seized upon and turned to account by Byron, whilst it
was as yet half-told, while the legend was still in the making.
Jean Lafitte, the Franco-American Conrad, was born either at
Bayonne or Bordeaux, circ. 1780, emigrated with his elder brother
Pierre, and settled at New Orleans, in 1809, as a blacksmith.
Legitimate trade was flat, but the delta of the Mississippi, with its
labyrinth of creeks and islands and <i>bayous</i>, teemed with pirates or
merchant-smugglers. Accordingly, under the nominal sanction of
letters of marque from the Republic of Cartagena, and as belligerents
of Spain, the brothers, who had taken up their quarters on Grande
Terre, an island to the east of the "Grand Pass," or channel of the
Bay of Barataria, swept the Gulph of Mexico with an organised
flotilla of privateers, and acquired vast booty in the way of specie
and living cargoes of claves. Hence the proclamation of the
Governor of Louisiana, W. C. C. Claiborne, in which (November
24, 1813) he offered a sum of $500 for the capture of Jean Lafitte.
For the sequel of this first act of the drama the "American newspaper"
is the sole authority. The facts, however, if facts they
be, which are pieced together by Charles &Eacute;tienne Arthur Gayarr&eacute;,
in the <i>History of Louisiana</i> (1885, iv. 301, sq.), and in two articles
contributed to the American <i>Magazine of History</i>, October and
November, 1883, are as curious and romantic as the legend. It
would appear that early in September, 1814, a British officer,
Colonel E. Nicholls, made overtures to Jean Lafitte, offering him
the rank of captain in the British army, a grant of lands, and a sum
of $30,000 if he would join forces with the British squadron then
engaged in an attack on the coast of Louisiana. Lafitte begged for
time to consider Colonel Nicholls's proposal, but immediately put
himself in communication with Claiborne, offering, on condition of
immunity for past offences, to place his resources at the disposal of
the United States. Claiborne's reply to this patriotic offer seems to
have been to despatch a strong naval force, under Commander Daniel
Patterson, with orders to exterminate the pirates, and seize their fort
on Grande Terre; and, on this occasion, though the brothers escaped,
the authorities were successful. A proclamation was issued by
General Andrew Jackson, in which the pirates were denounced as
"hellish banditti," and, to all appearances, their career was at an
end. But circumstances were in their favour, and a few weeks
later Jackson not only went back on his own mandate, but accepted
the alliance and services of the brothers Lafitte and their captains
at the siege of New Orleans, January 8, 1815. Finally, when peace
with Great Britain was concluded, President Madison publicly
acknowledged the "unequivocal traits of courage and fidelity"
which had been displayed by the brothers Lafitte, and the once
proscribed band of outlaws. Thenceforth Pierre Lafitte disappears
from history; but Jean is believed to have settled first at Galveston,
in Texas, and afterwards, in 1820, on the coast of Yucatan, whence
"he continued his depredations on Spanish commerce." He died
game, a pirate to the last, in 1826. See, for what purports to be
documentary evidence of the correspondence between Colonel E.
Nicholls and Jean Lafitte, <i>Historical Memoirs of the War in West
Florida and Louisiana</i>, by Major A. La Carri&eacute;re Latour, 1816,
Appendix III. pp. vii.-xv. See, too, <i>Fernando de Lemos</i> (an
historical novel), by Charles Gayarr&eacute;, 1872, pp. 347-361.]

</p><p>
In [the Rev. Mark] Noble's continuation of "Granger's <i>Biographical
History</i>" [<i>of England</i>, 1806, iii. 68], there is a singular
passage in his account of Archbishop Blackbourne [1658-1743]; and
as in some measure connected with the profession of the hero of the
foregoing poem, I cannot resist the temptation of extracting it.&mdash;"There
is something mysterious in the history and character of Dr.
Blackbourne. The former is but imperfectly known; and report
has even asserted he was a buccaneer; and that one of his brethren
in that profession having asked, on his arrival in England, what
had become of his old chum, Blackbourne, was answered, he
is Archbishop of York. We are informed, that Blackbourne
was installed sub-dean of Exeter in 1694, which office he resigned
in 1702; but after his successor Lewis Barnet's death, in 1704, he
regained it. In the following year he became dean; and in 1714 held
with it the archdeanery [i.e. archdeaconry] of Cornwall. He was
consecrated Bishop of Exeter, February 24, 1716; and translated to
York, November 28, 1724, as a reward, according to court scandal,
for uniting George I. to the Duchess of Munster. This, however,
appears to have been an unfounded calumny. As archbishop he
behaved with great prudence, and was equally respectable as the
guardian of the revenues of the see. Rumour whispered he retained
the vices of his youth, and that a passion for the fair sex formed an
item in the list of his weaknesses; but so far from being convicted
by seventy witnesses, he does not appear to have been directly
criminated by one. In short, I look upon these aspersions as the
effects of mere malice. How is it possible a buccaneer should have
been so good a scholar as Blackbourne certainly was? He who had
so perfect a knowledge of the classics (particularly of the Greek
tragedians), as to be able to read them with the same ease as he
could Shakespeare, must have taken great pains to acquire the
learned languages; and have had both leisure and good masters.
But he was undoubtedly educated at Christ-church College, Oxford.
He is allowed to have been a pleasant man; this, however, was
turned against him, by its being said, 'he gained more hearts than
souls.'"
</p><p>
[Walpole, in his <i>Memoirs of the Reign of King George II.</i>, 1847,
i. 87, who makes himself the mouthpiece of these calumnies, says
that Hayter, Bishop of Norwich, was "a natural son of Blackbourne,
the jolly old Archbishop of York, who had all the manners
of a man of quality, though he had been a Buccaneer, and was a
clergyman; but he retained nothing of his first profession except his
seraglio."]

"The only voice that could soothe the passions of the savage
(Alphonso III.) was that of an amiable and virtuous wife, the sole
object of his love; the voice of Donna Isabella, the daughter of the
Duke of Savoy, and the grand-daughter of Philip II. King of
Spain. Her dying words sunk deep into his memory [A.D. 1626,
August 22]; his fierce spirit melted into tears; and, after the last
embrace, Alphonso retired into his chamber to bewail his irreparable
loss, and to meditate on the vanity of human life."&mdash;Gibbon's

INTRODUCTION TO THE <i>ODE TO NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE.</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>

</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dedication of the <i>Corsair</i>, dated January 2, 1814,
contains one of Byron's periodical announcements that he is
about, for a time, to have done with authorship&mdash;some years
are to elapse before he will again "trespass on public patience."</p>

<p>Three months later he was, or believed himself to be, in
the same mind. In a letter to Moore, dated April 9, 1814
(<i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 64), he writes, "No more rhyme for&mdash;or
rather, <i>from</i>&mdash;me. I have taken my leave of that stage, and
henceforth will mountebank it no longer." He had already&mdash;<i>Journal</i>,
April 8 (<i>Letters</i>, 1898, ii. 408)&mdash;heard a rumour
"that his poor little pagod, Napoleon" was "pushed off his
pedestal," and before or after he began his letter to Moore
he must have read an announcement in the <i>Gazette Extraordinary</i>

(April 9, 1814&mdash;the abdication was signed April 11)
that Napoleon had abdicated the "throne of the world,"
and declined upon the kingdom of Elba. On the next day,
April 10, he wrote two notes to Murray, to inform him that
he had written an "ode on the fall of Napoleon," that
Murray could print it or not as he pleased; but that if it
appeared by itself, it was to be published anonymously. A
first edition consisting of fifteen stanzas, and numbering
fourteen pages, was issued on the 16th of April, 1814. A
second edition followed immediately, but as publications of
less than a sheet were liable to the stamp tax on newspapers,
at Murray's request, another stanza, the fifth, was inserted in
a later (between the second and the twelfth) edition, and,
by this means, the pamphlet was extended to seventeen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
pages. The concluding stanzas xvii., xviii., xix., which
Moore gives in a note (<i>Life</i>, p. 249), were not printed in
Byron's lifetime, but were first included, in a separate poem,
in Murray's edition of 1831, and first appended to the Ode
in the seventeen-volume edition of 1832.</p>

<p>Although he had stipulated that the <i>Ode</i> should be published
anonymously, Byron had no objection to "its being
said to be mine." There was, in short, no secret about it,
and notices on the whole favourable appeared in the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>, April 21,
in the <i>Examiner</i>, April 24 (in which
Leigh Hunt combated Byron's condemnation of Buonaparte
for not "dying as honour dies"), and in the <i>Anti-Jacobin</i> for
May, 1814 (<i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 73, note 3).</p>

<p>Byron's repeated resolutions and promises to cease writing
and publishing, which sound as if they were only made to
be broken, are somewhat exasperating, and if, as he pleaded
in his own behalf, the occasion (of Napoleon's abdication)
was <i>physically</i> irresistible, it is to be regretted that he did
not <i>swerve</i> from his self-denying ordinance to better purpose.
The note of disillusionment and disappointment in
the <i>Ode</i> is but an echo of the sentiments of the "general."
Napoleon on his own "fall" is more original and more interesting:
"Il c&eacute;da," writes L&eacute;onard Gallois
(<i>Histoire de Napol&eacute;on d'apr&egrave;s lui-m&ecirc;me</i>, 1825, pp. 546, 547),
"non sans de grands combats int&eacute;rieurs, et la dicta en ces termes.</p>

<blockquote><p>'Les puissances alli&eacute;es ayant proclam&eacute; que l'empereur
Napol&eacute;on &eacute;tait le seul obstacle au r&eacute;tablissement, de la paix
en Europe, l'empereur Napol&eacute;on fid&egrave;le &agrave; son serment,

INTRODUCTION TO <i>LARA</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> MS. of <i>Lara</i> is dated May 14, 1814. The opening
lines, which were not prefixed to the published poem, and
were first printed in <i>Murray's Magazine</i> (January, 1887),
are of the nature of a Dedication. They were probably
written a few days after the well-known song, "I speak not,
I trace not, I breathe not thy name," which was enclosed
to Moore in a letter dated May 4, 1814. There can be
little doubt that both song and dedication were addressed
to Lady Frances Wedderburn Webster, and that <i>Lara</i>,
like the <i>Corsair</i> and the <i>Bride of Abydos</i>, was written

<i>con amore</i>, and because the poet was "eating his heart away."</p>

<p>By the 14th of June Byron was able to announce to Moore
that "<i>Lara</i> was finished, and that he had begun copying."
It was written, owing to the length of the London season,
"amidst balls and fooleries, and after coming home from
masquerades and routs, in the summer of the sovereigns"
(Letter to Moore, June 8, 1822, <i>Life</i>, p. 561).</p>

<p>By way of keeping his engagement&mdash;already broken by the
publication of the <i>Ode to Napoleon Buonaparte</i>&mdash;not to
"trespass on public patience," Byron began by protesting
(June 14) that <i>Lara</i> was not to be published separately, but
"might be included in a third volume now collecting." A
fortnight later (June 27) an interchange of unpublished
poems between himself and Rogers, "two cantos of darkness
and dismay" in return for a privately printed copy of

<i>Jacqueline</i>, who is "all grace and softness and poetry"
(Letter to Rogers, <i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 101), suggested another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
and happier solution of the difficulty, a coalescing with
Rogers, and, if possible, Moore (<i>Life</i>, 1892, p. 257, note 2),
"into a joint invasion of the public" (Letter to Moore,
July 8, 1814, <i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 102). But Rogers hesitated,
and Moore refused to embark on so doubtful a venture, with
the result that, as late as the 3rd of August, Byron thought
fit to remonstrate with Murray for "advertising <i>Lara and
Jacqueline</i>," and confessed to Moore that he was "still
demurring and delaying and in a fuss" (<i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii.
115, 119). Murray knew his man, and, though he waited
for Byron's formal and ostensibly reluctant word of command,
"Out with Lara, since it must be" (August 5, 1814,
<i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 122), he admitted (August 6, <i>Memoir of
John Murray</i>, 1891, i. 230) that he had "anticipated his
consent," and "had done everything but actually deliver the
copies of <i>Lara</i>." "The moment," he adds, "I received
your letter, for for it I waited, I cut the last cord of my aerial
work, and at this instant 6000 copies are sold." <i>Lara, a
Tale</i>; <i>Jacqueline, a Tale</i>, was published on Saturday,
August 6, 1814.</p>

<p><i>Jacqueline</i> is a somewhat insipid pastoral, betraying the
influence of the Lake School, more especially Coleridge, on
a belated and irresponsive disciple, and wholly out of place
as contrast or foil to the melodramatic <i>Lara</i>.</p>

<p>No sooner had the "lady," as Byron was pleased to call
her, played her part as decoy, than she was discharged as
<i>emerita</i>. A week after publication (August 12, 1814, <i>Letters</i>,
iii. 125) Byron told Moore that "Murray talks of divorcing
Larry and Jacky&mdash;a bad sign for the authors, who will, I
suppose, be divorced too.... Seriously, I don't care a cigar
about it." The divorce was soon pronounced, and, contrary
to Byron's advice (September 2, 1814, <i>Letters</i>, iii. 131), at
least four separate editions of <i>Lara</i> were published during
the autumn of 1814.</p>

<p>The "advertisement" to <i>Lara and Jacqueline</i> contains
the plain statement that "the reader ... may probably
regard it [<i>Lara</i>] as a sequel to the <i>Corsair</i>"&mdash;an admission
on the author's part which forestalls and renders nugatory
any prolonged discussion on the subject. It is evident that
Lara is Conrad, and that Kaled, the "darkly delicate" and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
mysterious page, whose "hand is femininely white," is
Gulnare in a transparent and temporary disguise.</p>

<p>If the facts which the "English Gentleman in the Greek
Military Service" (<i>Life, Writings, etc., of Lord Byron</i>, 1825,
i. 191-201) gives in detail with regard to the sources of the

<i>Corsair</i> are not wholly imaginary, it is possible that the
original Conrad's determination to "quit so horrible a mode
of life" and return to civilization may have suggested to
Byron the possible adventures and fate of a <i>grand seigneur</i>
who had played the pirate in his time, and resumed his
ancestral dignities only to be detected and exposed by some
rival or victim of his wild and lawless youth.</p>

<p><i>Lara</i> was reviewed together with the <i>Corsair</i>, by George
Agar Ellis in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> for July, 1814, vol. xi.
p. 428; and in the <i>Portfolio</i>, vol. xiv. p. 33.</p>

<span class="i0">Ah! happier if it ne'er with guilt had glowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ever in that icy smoothness flowed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis true, with other men their path he walked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like the rest in seeming did and talked,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor outraged Reason's rules by flaw nor start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Madness was not of the head, but heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rarely wandered in his speech, or drew<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such sway, their infant monarch hardly reigned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now was the hour for Faction's rebel growth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Serfs contemned the one, and hated both:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They waited but a leader, and they found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One to their cause inseparably bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By circumstance compelled to plunge again,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In self-defence, amidst the strife of men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cut off by some mysterious fate from those<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Birth and Nature meant not for his foes,           <span class="linenum">880</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had Lara from that night, to him accurst,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prepared to meet, but not alone, the worst:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some reason urged, whate'er it was, to shun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inquiry into deeds at distance done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By mingling with his own the cause of all,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">E'en if he failed, he still delayed his fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sullen calm that long his bosom kept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The storm that once had spent itself and slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roused by events that seemed foredoomed to urge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His gloomy fortunes to their utmost verge,              <span class="linenum">890</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burst forth, and made him all he once had been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is again; he only changed the scene.<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Light care had he for life, and less for fame,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But not less fitted for the desperate game:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He deemed himself marked out for others' hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mocked at Ruin so they shared his fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cared he for the freedom of the crowd?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He raised the humble but to bend the proud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had hoped quiet in his sullen lair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Man and Destiny beset him there:               <span class="linenum">900</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inured to hunters, he was found at bay;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And they must kill, they cannot snare the prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stern, unambitious, silent, he had been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Henceforth a calm spectator of Life's scene;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dragged again upon the arena, stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A leader not unequal to the feud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In voice&mdash;mien&mdash;gesture&mdash;savage nature spoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from his eye the gladiator broke.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He heard a tramp&mdash;a horse and horseman broke<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From out the wood&mdash;before him was a cloak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapt round some burthen at his saddle-bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bent was his head, and hidden was his brow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roused by the sudden sight at such a time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some foreboding that it might be crime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself unheeded watched the stranger's course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who reached the river, bounded from his horse,       <span class="linenum">1210</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifting thence the burthen which he bore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Heaved up the bank, and dashed it from the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then paused&mdash;and looked&mdash;and turned&mdash;and seemed to watch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still another hurried glance would snatch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And follow with his step the stream that flowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if even yet too much its surface showed;<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
<span class="i0">At once he started&mdash;stooped&mdash;around him strown<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The winter floods had scattered heaps of stone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these the heaviest thence he gathered there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slung them with a more than common care.   <span class="linenum">1220</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the Serf had crept to where unseen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself might safely mark what this might mean;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He caught a glimpse, as of a floating breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And something glittered starlike on the vest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ere he well could mark the buoyant trunk,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A massy fragment smote it, and it sunk:<a name="FNanchor_lb" id="FNanchor_lb"></a><a href="#Footnote_lb" class="fnanchor">[lb]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">It rose again, but indistinct to view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the waters of a purple hue,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Till ebbed the latest eddy it had raised;      <span class="linenum">1230</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then turning, vaulted on his pawing steed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If dead it were, escaped the observer's dread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if in sooth a Star its bosom bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is the badge that Knighthood ever wore,<br /></span>

prefixed to the First Edition (Printed for J. Murray, Albemarle

by <i>Jacqueline:</i>&mdash;
</p>
<blockquote><p>"The Reader&mdash;if the tale of <i>Lara</i> has the fortune to meet
with one&mdash;may probably regard it as a sequel to the
<i>Corsair</i>;&mdash;the colouring
is of a similar cast, and although the situations of the characters are
changed, the stories are in some measure connected. The countenance
is nearly the same&mdash;but with a different expression. To the
readers' conjecture are left the name of the writer and the failure or
success of his attempt&mdash;the latter are the only points upon which the
author or his judges can feel interested.

</p><p>
"The Poem of <i>Jaqueline</i> is the production of a different author and
is added at the request of the writer of the former tale, whose wish
and entreaty it was that it should occupy the first pages of the following
volume, and he regrets that the tenacious courtesy of his friend
would not permit him to place it where the judgement of the reader
concurring with his own will suggest its more appropriate station."]</p></blockquote>

and no circumstance of local and natural description fixing the scene
or hero of the poem to any country or age, the word "Serf," which
could not be correctly applied to the lower classes in Spain, who
were never vassals of the soil, has nevertheless been employed to
designate the followers of our fictitious chieftain.

The event in this section was suggested by the description of
the death or rather burial of the Duke of Gandia. "The most interesting
and particular account of it is given by Burchard, and is in
substance as follows:&mdash;'On the eighth day of June, the Cardinal of
Valenza and the Duke of Gandia, sons of the pope, supped with
their mother, Vanozza, near the church of <i>S. Pietro ad vincula</i>:
several other persons being present at the entertainment. A late
hour approaching, and the cardinal having reminded his brother that
it was time to return to the apostolic palace, they mounted their
horses or mules, with only a few attendants, and proceeded together
as far as the palace of Cardinal Ascanio Sforza, when the duke
informed the cardinal that, before he returned home, he had to pay
a visit of pleasure. Dismissing therefore all his attendants, excepting
his <i>staffiero</i>, or footman, and a person in a mask, who had paid
him a visit whilst at supper, and who, during the space of a month
or thereabouts, previous to this time, had called upon him almost
daily at the apostolic palace, he took this person behind him on his
mule, and proceeded to the street of the Jews, where he quitted his
servant, directing him to remain there until a certain hour; when,
if he did not return, he might repair to the palace. The duke then
seated the person in the mask behind him, and rode I know not
whither; but in that night he was assassinated, and thrown into the
river. The servant, after having been dismissed, was also assaulted
and mortally wounded; and although he was attended with great
care, yet such was his situation, that he could give no intelligible
account of what had befallen his master. In the morning, the duke
not having returned to the palace, his servants began to be alarmed;
and one of them informed the pontiff of the evening excursion of his
sons, and that the duke had not yet made his appearance. This
gave the pope no small anxiety; but he conjectured that the duke
had been attracted by some courtesan to pass the night with her,
and, not choosing to quit the house in open day, had waited till the
following evening to return home. When, however, the evening
arrived, and he found himself disappointed in his expectations, he
became deeply afflicted, and began to make inquiries from different
persons, whom he ordered to attend him for that purpose. Amongst
these was a man named Giorgio Schiavoni, who, having discharged
some timber from a bark in the river, had remained on board the
vessel to watch it; and being interrogated whether he had seen any
one thrown into the river on the night preceding, he replied, that he
saw two men on foot, who came down the street, and looked diligently
about to observe whether any person was passing. That
seeing no one, they returned, and a short time afterwards two others
came, and looked around in the same manner as the former: no
person still appearing, they gave a sign to their companions, when a
man came, mounted on a white horse, having behind him a dead
body, the head and arms of which hung on one side, and the feet on
the other side of the horse; the two persons on foot supporting the
body, to prevent its falling. They thus proceeded towards that part
where the filth of the city is usually discharged into the river, and
turning the horse, with his tail towards the water, the two persons
took the dead body by the arms and feet, and with all their strength
flung it into the river. The person on horseback then asked if they
had thrown it in; to which they replied, <i>Signor, si</i> (yes, Sir). He
then looked towards the river, and seeing a mantle floating on the
stream, he enquired what it was that appeared black, to which they
answered, it was a mantle; and one of them threw stones upon it,
in consequence of which it sunk. The attendants of the pontiff then
enquired from Giorgio, why he had not revealed this to the governor
of the city; to which he replied, that he had seen in his time a
hundred dead bodies thrown into the river at the same place, without
any inquiry being made respecting them; and that he had not,
therefore, considered it as a matter of any importance. The fishermen
and seamen were then collected, and ordered to search the
river, where, on the following evening, they found the body of the
duke, with his habit entire, and thirty ducats in his purse. He was
pierced with nine wounds, one of which was in his throat, the others
in his head, body, and limbs. No sooner was the pontiff informed
of the death of his son, and that he had been thrown, like filth, into
the river, than, giving way to his grief, he shut himself up in a
chamber, and wept bitterly. The Cardinal of Segovia, and other
attendants on the pope, went to the door, and after many hours
spent in persuasions and exhortations, prevailed upon him to admit
them. From the evening of Wednesday till the following Saturday
the pope took no food; nor did he sleep from Thursday morning till
the same hour on the ensuing day. At length, however, giving way
to the entreaties of his attendants, he began to restrain his sorrow,
and to consider the injury which his own health might sustain by the
further indulgence of his grief.'"&mdash;Roscoe's <i>Life and Pontificate of

INTRODUCTION TO <i>HEBREW MELODIES</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">According</span> to the "Advertisement" prefixed to Murray's
First Edition of the <i>Hebrew Melodies</i>, London, 1815 (the
date, January, 1815, was appended in 1832), the "poems were
written at the request of the author's friend, the Hon. D.
Kinnaird, for a selection of Hebrew Melodies, and have been
published, with the music, arranged by Mr. Braham and Mr. Nathan."</p>

<p>Byron's engagement to Miss Milbanke took place in
September, 1814, and the remainder of the year was passed
in London, at his chambers in the Albany. The so-called
<i>Hebrew Melodies</i> were, probably, begun in the late autumn
of that year, and were certainly finished at Seaham, after his
marriage had taken place, in January-February, 1815. It is
a natural and pardonable conjecture that Byron took to
writing sacred or, at any rate, scriptural verses by way of
giving pleasure and doing honour to his future wife, "the
girl who gave to song What gold could never buy." They
were, so to speak, the first-fruits of a seemlier muse.</p>

<p>It is probable that the greater number of these poems were
in MS. before it occurred to Byron's friend and banker, the
Honble. Douglas James William Kinnaird (1788-1830), to
make him known to Isaac Nathan (1792-1864), a youthful
composer of "musical farces and operatic works," who had
been destined by his parents for the Hebrew priesthood, but
had broken away, and, after some struggles, succeeded in
qualifying himself as a musician.</p>

<p>Byron took a fancy to Nathan, and presented him with the
copyright of his "poetical effusions," on the understanding
that they were to be set to music and sung in public by John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Braham. "Professional occupations" prevented Braham
from fulfilling his part of the engagement, but a guinea folio
(Part. I.) ("<i>Selections of Hebrew Melodies, Ancient and Modern</i>,
with appropriate symphonies and accompaniments,
by I. Braham and I. Nathan, the poetry written expressly
for the work by the Right Honourable Lord Byron")&mdash;with
an ornamental title-page designed by the architect Edward
Blore (1789-1879), and dedicated to the Princess Charlotte
of Wales&mdash;was published in April, 1815. A second part was
issued in 1816.</p>

<p>The preface, part of which was reprinted (p. vi.) by
Nathan, in his
<i>Fugitive Pieces and Reminiscences of Lord Byron</i>,
London, 1829, is not without interest&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"The Hebrew Melodies are a selection from the favourite
airs which are still sung in the religious ceremonies of the
Jews. Some of these have, in common with all their Sacred
airs, been preserved by memory and tradition alone, without
the assistance of written characters. Their age and
originality, therefore, must be left to conjecture. But the
latitude given to the taste and genius of their performers has
been the means of engrafting on the original Melodies a
certain wildness and pathos, which have at length become
the chief characteristics of the sacred songs of the Jews....</p>

<p>"Of the poetry it is necessary to speak, in order thus
publicly to acknowledge the kindness with which Lord Byron
has condescended to furnish the most valuable part of the
work. It has been our endeavour to select such melodies as
would best suit the style and sentiment of the poetry."</p></blockquote>

<p>Moore, for whose benefit the Melodies had been rehearsed,
was by no means impressed by their "wildness and pathos,"
and seems to have twitted Byron on the subject, or, as he
puts it (<i>Life</i>, p. 276), to have taken the liberty of "laughing
a little at the manner in which some of the Hebrew Melodies
had been set to music." The author of <i>Sacred Songs</i> (1814)
set to airs by Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, etc., was a critic
not to be gainsaid, but from the half-comical petulance with
which he "curses" and "sun-burns" (Letters to Moore,
February 22, March 8, 1815, <i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 179, 183)
Nathan, and his "vile Ebrew nasalities," it is evident that
Byron winced under Moore's "chaff."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Apart from the merits or demerits of the setting, the title
<i>Hebrew Melodies</i> is somewhat misleading. Three love-songs,
"She walks in Beauty like the Night," "Oh! snatched away
in Beauty's Bloom," and "I saw thee weep," still form part of
the collection; and, in Nathan's folio (which does not contain
"A spirit passed before me"), two fragments, "It is
the hour when from the boughs" and "Francesca walks in
the shadow of night," which were afterwards incorporated
in <i>Parisina</i>, were included. The <i>Fugitive Pieces</i>, 1829,
retain the fragments from <i>Parisina</i>, and add the following
hitherto unpublished poems: "I speak not, I trace not," etc.,
"They say that Hope is Happiness," and the genuine but
rejected Hebrew Melody "In the valley of waters we wept on the day."</p>

<p>It is uncertain when Murray's first edition appeared.
Byron wrote to Nathan with regard to the copyright in
January, 1815 (<i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 167), but it is unlikely that
the volume was put on the market before Nathan's folio,
which was advertised for the first time in the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, April 6, 1815; and it is possible that the first
public announcement of the <i>Hebrew Melodies</i>, as a separate
issue, was made in the <i>Courier</i>, June 22, 1815.</p>

<p>The <i>Hebrew Melodies</i> were reviewed in the <i>Christian
Observer</i>, August, 1815, vol. xiv. p. 542; in the <i>Analectic
Magazine</i>, October, 1815, vol. vi. p. 292; and were noticed by
Jeffrey [The <i>Hebrew Melodies</i>, though "obviously inferior"
to Lord Byron's other works, "display a skill in versification
and a mastery in diction which would have raised an inferior
artist to the very summit of distinction"] in the <i>Edinburgh
Review</i>, December, 1816, vol. xxvii. p. 291.

[In a manuscript note to a letter of Byron's, dated June 11,
1814, Wedderburn Webster writes, "I <i>did</i> take him to Lady
Sitwell's party.... He there for the first time saw his cousin, the
beautiful Mrs. Wilmot [who had appeared in mourning with
numerous spangles in her dress]. When we returned to ... the
Albany, he ... desired Fletcher to give him a <i>tumbler of brandy</i>,
which he drank at once to Mrs. Wilmot's health.... The next
day he wrote some charming lines upon her, 'She walks in beauty,'
etc."&mdash;<i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 92, note 1.
</p><p>
Anne Beatrix, daughter and co-heiress of Eusebius Horton, of
Catton Hall, Derbyshire, married Byron's second cousin, Robert John
Wilmot (1784-1841), son of Sir Robert Wilmot of Osmaston, by
Juliana, second daughter of the Hon. John Byron, and widow of the
Hon. William Byron. She died February 4, 1871.
</p><p>
Nathan (<i>Fugitive Pieces</i>, 1829, pp. 2, 3) has a note to the effect
that Byron, while arranging the first edition of the <i>Melodies</i>,
used to ask for this song,
and would not unfrequently join in its execution.]</p></div>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION_CORINTH" id="INTRODUCTION_CORINTH"></a>
INTRODUCTION TO <i>THE SIEGE OF CORINTH</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p>In a note to the "Advertisement" to the <i>Siege of Corinth</i>
(<i>vide post</i>, <a href="#Page_447">p. 447</a>), Byron puts it on record that during the
years 1809-10 he had crossed the Isthmus of Corinth eight
times, and in a letter to his mother, dated Patras, July 30,
1810, he alludes to a recent visit to the town of Corinth, in
company with his friend Lord Sligo. (See, too, his letter to
Coleridge, dated October 27, 1815, <i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 228.)
It is probable that he revisited Corinth more than once in
the autumn of 1810; and we may infer that, just as the
place and its surroundings&mdash;the temple with its "two or
three columns" (line 497), and the view across the bay from
Acro-Corinth&mdash;are sketched from memory, so the story of
the siege which took place in 1715 is based upon tales and
legends which were preserved and repeated by the grandchildren
of the besieged, and were taken down from their
lips. There is point and meaning in the apparently insignificant
line (stanza xxiv. line 765), "We have heard the
hearers say" (see <i>variant</i> i. p. 483), which is slipped into
the description of the final catastrophe. It bears witness
to the fact that the <i>Siege of Corinth</i> is not a poetical expansion
of a chapter in history, but a heightened reminiscence
of local tradition.</p>

<p>History has, indeed, very little to say on the subject.
The anonymous <i>Compleat History of the Turks</i> (London, 1719),
which Byron quotes as an authority, is meagre and
inaccurate. Hammer-Purgstall (<i>Histoire de l'Empire Ottoman</i>,
1839, xiii. 269), who gives as his authorities Girolamo
Ferrari and Raschid, dismisses the siege in a few lines; and
it was not till the publication of Finlay's <i>History of Greece</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
(vol. v., <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 1453-1821), in 1856, that the facts were known
or reported. Finlay's newly discovered authority was a then
unpublished MS. of a journal kept by Benjamin Brue, a connection
of Voltaire's, who accompanied the Grand Vizier,
Ali Cumurgi, as his interpreter, on the expedition into the
Morea. According to Brue (<i>Journal de la Campagne ... en</i>
1715 ... Paris, 1870, p. 18), the siege began on June 28,
1715. A peremptory demand on the part of the Grand
Vizier to surrender at discretion was answered by the Venetian
proveditor-general, Giacomo Minetto, with calm but
assured defiance ("Your menaces are useless, for we are prepared
to resist all your attacks, and, with confidence in the
assistance of God, we will preserve this fortress to the most
serene Republic. God is with us"). Nevertheless, the Turks
made good their threat, and on the 2nd of July the fortress
capitulated. On the following day at noon, whilst a
party of Janissaries, contrary to order, were looting and pillaging
in all directions, the fortress was seen to be enveloped
in smoke. How or why the explosion happened was never
discovered, but the result was that some of the pillaging
Janissaries perished, and that others, to avenge their death,
which they attributed to Venetian treachery, put the garrison
to the sword. It was believed at the time that Minetto was
among the slain; but, as Brue afterwards discovered, he was
secretly conveyed to Smyrna, and ultimately ransomed by
the Dutch Consul.</p>

<p>The late Professor K&ouml;lbing (<i>Siege of Corinth</i>, 1893, p.
xxvii.), in commenting on the sources of the poem, suggests,
under reserve, that Byron may have derived the incident
of Minetto's self-immolation from an historic source&mdash;the
siege of Zsigetvar, in 1566, when a multitude of Turks
perished from the explosion of a powder magazine which
had been fired at the cost of his own life by the Hungarian
commander Zrini.</p>

<p>It is, at least, equally probable that local patriotism was, in
the first instance, responsible for the poetic colouring, and
that Byron supplemented the meagre and uninteresting historic
details which were at his disposal by "intimate knowledge"
of the Corinthian version of the siege. (See <i>Memoirs
of the Life and Writings of the Right Hon. Lord Byron</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
London, 1822, p. 222; and <i>Memoirs of the Life and Writings
of Lord Byron</i>, by George Clinton, London, 1825, p. 284.)</p>

<p>It has been generally held that the <i>Siege of Corinth</i> was
written in the second half of 1815 (K&ouml;lbing's <i>Siege of Corinth</i>,
p. vii.). "It appears," says John Wright (<i>Works</i>, 1832,
x. 100), "by the original MS., to have been begun in July,
1815;" and Moore (<i>Life</i>, p. 307), who probably relied on the
same authority, speaks of "both the <i>Siege of Corinth</i> and
<i>Parisina</i> having been produced but a short time before the
Separation" (i.e. spring, 1816). Some words which Medwin
(<i>Conversations</i>, 1824, p. 55) puts into Byron's mouth point to
the same conclusion. Byron's own testimony, which is completely
borne out by the MS. itself (dated J<span class="sup">y</span> [i.e. January,
not July] 31, 1815), is in direct conflict with these statements.
In a note to stanza xix. lines 521-532 (<i>vide post</i>, pp. <a href="#Page_471">471</a>-473)
he affirms that it "was not till after these lines were written"
that he heard "that wild and singularly original and beautiful
poem [<i>Christabel</i>] recited;" and in a letter to S. T. Coleridge,
dated October 27, 1815 (<i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 228), he is careful
to explain that "the enclosed extract from an unpublished
poem (i.e. stanza xix. lines 521-532) ... was written before
(not seeing your <i>Christabelle</i> [sic], for that you know I never
did till this day), but before I heard Mr. S[cott] repeat it,
which he did in June last, and this thing was begun in
January, and more than half written before the Summer."
The question of plagiarism will be discussed in an addendum
to Byron's note on the lines in question; but, subject to the
correction that it was, probably, at the end of May (see
Lockhart's <i>Memoir of the Life of Sir W. Scott</i>, 1871, pp.
311-313), not in June, that Scott recited <i>Christabel</i> for
Byron's benefit, the date of the composition of the poem
must be determined by the evidence of the author himself.</p>

<p>The copy of the MS. of the <i>Siege of Corinth</i> was sent to
Murray at the beginning (probably on the 2nd, the date of
the copy) of November, and was placed in Gifford's hands
about the same time (see letter to Murray, November 4, 1815,
<i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 245; and Murray's undated letter on
Gifford's "great delight" in the poem, and his "three critical
remarks," <i>Memoir of John Murray</i>, 1891, i. 356). As with
<i>Lara</i>, Byron began by insisting that the <i>Siege</i> should not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
published separately, but slipped into a fourth volume of the
collected works, and once again (possibly when he had at
last made up his mind to accept a thousand guineas for his
own requirements, and not for other beneficiaries&mdash;Godwin,
Coleridge, or Maturin) yielded to his publisher's wishes and
representations. At any rate, the <i>Siege of Corinth</i> and

<i>Parisina</i>, which, says Moore, "during the month of January
and part of February were in the hands of the printers" (<i>Life</i>,
p. 300), were published in a single volume on February 7,
1816. The greater reviews were silent, but notices appeared
in numerous periodicals; e.g. the <i>Monthly Review</i>, February,
1816, vol. lxxix. p. 196; the <i>Eclectic Review</i>, March, 1816,
N.S. vol. v. p. 269; the <i>European</i>, May, 1816, vol. lxxix. p.
427; the <i>Literary Panorama</i>, June, 1816, N.S. vol. iv. p.
418; etc. Many of these reviews took occasion to pick out
and hold up to ridicule the illogical sentences, the grammatical
solecisms, and general imperfections of <i>technique</i>
which marked and disfigured the <i>Siege of Corinth</i>. A
passage in a letter which John Murray wrote to his brother-publisher,
William Blackwood (<i>Annals of a Publishing House</i>, 1897, i. 53),
refers to these cavillings, and suggests
both an apology and a retaliation&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>"Many who by 'numbers judge a poet's song' are so
stupid as not to see the powerful effect of the poems, which
is the great object of poetry, because they can pick out fifty
careless or even bad lines. The words may be carelessly
put together; but this is secondary. Many can write
polished lines who will never reach the name of poet. You
see it is all poetically conceived in Lord B.'s mind."</p></blockquote>

<p>In such wise did Murray bear testimony to Byron's
"splendid and imperishable excellence, which covers all his
offences and outweighs all his defects&mdash;the excellence of
sincerity and strength."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span></p>

thought it best in the first place to attack Corinth, upon
which they made several storms. The garrison being
weakened, and the governor seeing it was impossible to
hold out such a place against so mighty a force, thought
it fit to beat a parley: but while they were treating about
the articles, one of the magazines in the Turkish camp,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
wherein they had six hundred barrels of powder, blew up
by accident, whereby six or seven hundred men were
killed; which so enraged the infidels, that they would
not grant any capitulation, but stormed the place with
so much fury, that they took it, and put most of the
garrison, with Signior Minotti, the governor, to the sword.

Napoli di Romania is not now the most considerable place in
the Morea, but Tripolitza, where the Pacha resides, and maintains
his government. Napoli is near Argos. I visited all three in
1810-11; and, in the course of journeying through the country
from my first arrival in 1809, I crossed the Isthmus eight times in
my way from Attica to the Morea, over the mountains; or in the
other direction, when passing from the Gulf of Athens to that of
Lepanto. Both the routes are picturesque and beautiful, though
very different: that by sea has more sameness; but the voyage,
being always within sight of land, and often very near it, presents
many attractive views of the islands Salamis, &AElig;gina, Poros, etc.,
and the coast of the Continent.

["Independently of the suitableness of such an event to the power
of Lord Byron's genius, the Fall of Corinth afforded local attractions,
by the intimate knowledge which the poet had of the place
and surrounding objects.... Thus furnished with that topographical
information which could not be well obtained from books and maps,
he was admirably qualified to depict the various operations and
progress of the siege."&mdash;<i>Memoir of the Life and Writings of the
Right Honourable Lord Byron</i>, London, 1822, p. 222.]</p></div>

[The introductory lines, 1-45, are not included in the copy of
the poem in Lady Byron's handwriting, nor were they published in
the First Edition. On Christmas Day, 1815, Byron, enclosing this
fragment to Murray, says, "I send some lines written some time
ago, and intended as an opening to the <i>Siege of Corinth</i>.
I had forgotten them, and am not sure that they had not better be left
out now;&mdash;on that you and your Synod can determine." They
are headed in the MS., "The Stranger's Tale," October 23rd.

[Professor Kolbing admits that he is unable to say how "Byron
met with the name of Alp." I am indebted to my cousin, Miss
Edith Coleridge, for the suggestion that the name is derived from
Mohammed (Lhaz-ed-Dyn-Abou-Choudja), surnamed Alp-Arslan
(Arsslan), or "Brave Lion," the second of the Seljuk dynasty, in
the eleventh century. "He conquered Armenia and Georgia ... but
was assassinated by Yussuf Cothuol, Governor of Berzem, and
was buried at Merw, in Khorassan." His epitaph moralizes his fate:

Germans, at the battle of Peterwaradin (in the plain of Carlowitz),
in Hungary, endeavouring to rally his guards. He died of his
wounds next day [August 16, 1716]. His last order was the decapitation
of General Breuner, and some other German prisoners, and
his last words, "Oh that I could thus serve all the Christian dogs!"
a speech and act not unlike one of Caligula. He was a young man
of great ambition and unbounded presumption: on being told that
Prince Eugene, then opposed to him, "was a great general," he
said, "I shall become a greater, and at his expense."

[Gifford has drawn his pen through lines 456-478.
If, as the editor of <i>The Works of Lord Byron</i>, 1832 (x. 100),
maintains, "Lord Byron gave Mr. Gifford <i>carte blanche</i>

to strike out or alter anything
at his pleasure in this poem as it was passing through the press," it
is somewhat remarkable that he does not appear to have paid any
attention whatever to the august "reader's" suggestions and strictures.
The sheets on which Gifford's corrections are scrawled are
not proof-sheets, but pages torn out of the first edition; and it is
probable that they were made after the poem was published, and
with a view to the inclusion of an emended edition in the collected
works. See letter to Murray, January 2, 1817.]</p></div>

I must here acknowledge a close, though unintentional, resemblance
in these twelve lines to a passage in an unpublished poem of
Mr. Coleridge, called "Christabel." It was not till after these
lines were written that I heard that wild and singularly original and
beautiful poem recited; and the MS. of that production I never
saw till very recently, by the kindness of Mr. Coleridge himself,
who, I hope, is convinced that I have not been a wilful plagiarist.
The original idea undoubtedly pertains to Mr. Coleridge, whose
poem has been composed above fourteen years. Let me conclude
by a hope that he will not longer delay the publication of a production,
of which I can only add my mite of approbation to the
applause of far more competent judges.

Byron (<i>vide ante</i>, <a href="#Page_443">p. 443</a>), in a letter to Coleridge,
dated October 27, 1815, had already expressly guarded himself
against a charge of
plagiarism, by explaining that lines 521-532 of stanza xix. were
written before he heard Walter Scott repeat <i>Christabel</i>
in the preceding June. Now, as Byron himself perceived, perhaps for the
first time, when he had the MS. of <i>Christabel</i> before him,
the coincidence in language and style between the two passages is
unquestionable; and, as he hoped and expected that Coleridge's
fragment, when completed, would issue from the press,
he was anxious to avoid even the semblance of pilfering,
and went so far as to suggest that the passage should be cancelled.
Neither in the private letter nor the published note does
Byron attempt to deny or explain away the coincidence,
but pleads that his lines were written before he had heard
Coleridge's poem recited, and that he had not been guilty of a
"wilful plagiarism." There is no difficulty in accepting his statement.
Long before the summer of 1815 <i>Christabel</i> "had a pretty
general circulation in the literary world" (Medwin, <i>Conversations</i>,
1824, p. 261), and he may have heard without heeding this and
other passages quoted by privileged readers; or, though never a line
of <i>Christabel</i> had sounded in his ears, he may (as K&ouml;lbing points
out) have caught its lilt at second hand from the published works of
Southey, or of Scott himself.

[Contemporary critics fell foul of these lines for various reasons.
The <i>Critical Review</i> (February, 1816, vol. iii. p. 151) remarks that
"the following couplet [i.e. lines 531, 532]
reminds us of the <i>persiflage</i>

of Lewis or the pathos of a vulgar ballad;"
while the <i>Dublin Examiner</i> (May, 1816, vol. i. p. 19)
directs a double charge against
the founders of the schism and their proselyte:
"If the Cumberland <i>Lakers</i> were not well known
to be personages of the most pious and
saintly temperament, we would really have serious apprehensions
lest our noble Poet should come to any harm in consequence of the
envy which the two following lines and a great many others through
the poems, might excite by their successful rivalship of some of the
finest effects of babyism that these Gentlemen can boast."]</p></div>

[In the summer of 1803, Byron, then turned fifteen, though
offered a bed at Annesley, used at first to return every night to
Newstead; alleging that he was afraid of the family pictures of the
Chaworths, which he fancied "had taken a grudge to him on
account of the duel, and would come down from their frames to
haunt him." Moore thinks this passage may have been suggested
by the recollection (<i>Life</i>, p. 27).

xi. line 1, <i>seq</i>. (<i>vide ante</i>, <a href="#Page_331">p. 331</a>, <a href="#Footnote_273">note 1</a>).]</p></div>

this and the five
following lines has been admired by those whose approbation is
valuable. I am glad of it; but it is not original&mdash;at least not mine;
it may be found much better expressed in pages 182-3-4 of the
English version of "Vathek" (I forget the precise page of the
French), a work to which I have before referred; and never recur
to, or read, without a renewal of gratification.&mdash;[The following is
the passage: "'Deluded prince!' said the Genius, addressing the
Caliph ... 'This moment is the last, of grace, allowed thee: ...
give back Nouronihar to her father, who still retains a few sparks of
life: destroy thy tower, with all its abominations: drive Carathis
from thy councils: be just to thy subjects: respect the ministers of
the Prophet: compensate for thy impieties by an exemplary life;
and, instead of squandering thy days in voluptuous indulgence,
lament thy crimes on the sepulchres of thy ancestors. Thou beholdest
the clouds that obscure the sun: at the instant he recovers
his splendour, if thy heart be not changed, the time of mercy
assigned thee will be past for ever.'"

</p><p>
"Vathek, depressed with fear, was on the point of prostrating
himself at the feet of the shepherd ... but, his pride prevailing ...
he said, 'Whoever thou art, withhold thy useless admonitions....
If what I have done be so criminal ... there remains not for me
a moment of grace. I have traversed a sea of blood to acquire a
power which will make thy equals tremble; deem not that I shall
retire when in view of the port; or that I will relinquish her who
is dearer to me than either my life or thy mercy. Let the sun
appear! let him illumine my career! it matters not where it may
end!' On uttering these words ... Vathek ... commanded that
his horses should be forced back to the road.
</p><p>
"There was no difficulty in obeying these orders; for the attraction
had ceased; the sun shone forth in all his glory, and the shepherd
vanished with a lamentable scream" (ed. 1786, pp. 183-185).]</p></div>

A sentence in a letter to Moore, dated January 10, 1815
(<i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 168),
"<i>I</i> have tried the rascals (i.e. the public) with my
Harrys and Larrys, Pilgrims and Pirates. Nobody but S....y has
done any thing worth a slice of bookseller's pudding,
and <i>he</i> has not
luck enough to be found out in doing a good thing," implies that
Byron had read and admired Southey's <i>Roderick</i>&mdash;an inference
which is curiously confirmed by a memorandum in Murray's handwriting:
"When Southey's poem, <i>Don Roderick</i> (<i>sic</i>), was published,
Lord Byron sent in the middle of the night to ask John
Murray if he had heard any opinion of it, for he thought it one of
the finest poems he had ever read." The resemblance between the
two passages, which is pointed out by Professor K&ouml;lbing, is too close
to be wholly unconscious, but Byron's expansion of Southey's lines
hardly amounts to a plagiarism.]

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION_PARISINA" id="INTRODUCTION_PARISINA"></a>
INTRODUCTION TO <i>PARISINA</i>.
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Parisina</i></span>, which had been begun before the
<i>Siege of Corinth</i>, was transcribed by Lady Byron, and sent to the
publisher at the beginning of December, 1815. Murray confessed
that he had been alarmed by some hints which Byron
had dropped as to the plot of the narrative, but was reassured
when he traced "the delicate hand that transcribed it." He
could not say enough of this "Pearl" of great price. "It is
very interesting, pathetic, beautiful&mdash;do you know I would
almost say moral" (<i>Memoir of John Murray</i>, 1891, i. 353).
Ward, to whom the MS. of <i>Parisina</i> was shown, and Isaac
D'Israeli, who heard it read aloud by Murray, were enthusiastic
as to its merits; and Gifford, who had mingled
censure with praise in his critical appreciation of the <i>Siege</i>,
declared that the author "had never surpassed <i>Parisina</i>."</p>

<p>The last and shortest of the six narrative poems composed
and published in the four years (the first years of
manhood and of fame, the only years of manhood passed at
home in England) which elapsed between the appearance
of the first two cantos of <i>Childe Harold</i> and the third,
<i>Parisina</i> has, perhaps, never yet received its due. At the
time of its appearance it shared the odium which was provoked
by the publication of <i>Fare Thee Well</i> and <i>A Sketch</i>,
and before there was time to reconsider the new volume on
its own merits, the new canto of <i>Childe Harold</i>, followed
almost immediately by the <i>Prisoner of Chillon</i> and its
brilliant and noticeable companion poems, usurped the
attention of friend and foe. Contemporary critics (with the
exception of the <i>Monthly</i> and <i>Critical</i> Reviews) fell foul of
the subject-matter of the poem&mdash;the guilty passion of a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[500]</a></span>
bastard son for his father's wife. "It was too disgusting to
be rendered pleasing by any display of genius"
(<i>European Magazine</i>);
"The story of <i>Parisina</i> includes adultery not to be named"
(<i>Literary Panorama</i>); while the <i>Eclectic</i>, on
grounds of taste rather than of morals, gave judgment that
"the subject of the tale was purely unpleasing"&mdash;"the impression
left simply painful."</p>

<p>Byron, no doubt, for better or worse, was in advance of
his age, in the pursuit of art for art's sake, and in his indifference,
not to morality&mdash;the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> of the story is severely
moral&mdash;but to the moral edification of his readers. The tale
was chosen because it is a tale of love and guilt and woe,
and the poet, unconcerned with any other issue, sets the tale
to an enchanting melody. It does not occur to him to condone
or to reprobate the loves of Hugo and Parisina, and in
detailing the issue leaves the actors to their fate. It was
this aloofness from ethical considerations which perturbed
and irritated the "canters," as Byron called them&mdash;the
children and champions of the anti-revolution. The modern
reader, without being attracted or repelled by the <i>motif</i> of
the story, will take pleasure in the sustained energy and sure
beauty of the poetic strain. Byron may have gone to the
"nakedness of history" for his facts, but he clothed them in
singing robes of a delicate and shining texture.

<p>The following poem is grounded on a circumstance
mentioned in Gibbon's "Antiquities of the House of
Brunswick." I am aware, that in modern times, the
delicacy or fastidiousness of the reader may deem such
subjects unfit for the purposes of poetry. The Greek
dramatists, and some of the best of our old English writers,
were of a different opinion: as Alfieri and Schiller have
also been, more recently, upon the Continent. The
following extract will explain the facts on which the
story is founded. The name of <i>Azo</i> is substituted for
Nicholas, as more metrical.&mdash;[B.]</p>

<p>"Under the reign of Nicholas III. [A.D. 1425] Ferrara
was polluted with a domestic tragedy. By the testimony
of a maid, and his own observation, the Marquis of Este
discovered the incestuous loves of his wife Parisina, and
Hugo his bastard son, a beautiful and valiant youth.
They were beheaded in the castle by the sentence of a
father and husband, who published his shame, and survived
their execution.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> He was unfortunate, if they were
guilty: if they were innocent, he was still more unfortunate;
nor is there any possible situation in which I can
sincerely approve the last act of the justice of a
parent."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gibbon's</span> <i>Miscellaneous Works</i>,

were beheaded, according to the annal of Gibbon."&mdash;<i>Vide</i> Advertisement

"This turned out a calamitous year for the people of Ferrara,
for there occurred a very tragical event in the court of their
sovereign. Our annals, both printed and in manuscript, with the
exception of the unpolished and negligent work of Sardi, and one
other, have given the following relation of it,&mdash;from which, however,
are rejected many details, and especially the narrative of Bandelli,
who wrote a century afterwards, and who does not accord with the
contemporary historians.
</p><p>
"By the above-mentioned Stella dell' Assassino, the Marquis, in
the year 1405, had a son called Ugo, a beautiful and ingenuous
youth. Parisina Malatesta, second wife of Niccolo, like the
generality of step-mothers, treated him with little kindness, to the
infinite regret of the Marquis, who regarded him with fond partiality.
One day she asked leave of her husband to undertake a certain
journey, to which he consented, but upon condition that Ugo should
bear her company; for he hoped by these means to induce her, in
the end, to lay aside the obstinate aversion which she had conceived
against him. And indeed his intent was accomplished but too well,
since, during the journey, she not only divested herself of all her
hatred, but fell into the opposite extreme. After their return, the
Marquis had no longer any occasion to renew his former reproofs.
It happened one day that a servant of the Marquis, named Zoese,
or, as some call him, Giorgio, passing before the apartments of
Parisina, saw going out from them one of her chamber-maids, all
terrified and in tears. Asking the reason, she told him that her
mistress, for some slight offence, had been beating her; and, giving
vent to her rage, she added, that she could easily be revenged, if
she chose to make known the criminal familiarity which subsisted
between Parisina and her step-son. The servant took note of the
words, and related them to his master. He was astounded thereat,
but, scarcely believing his ears, he assured himself of the fact, alas!
too clearly, on the 18th of May, by looking through a hole made in
the ceiling of his wife's chamber. Instantly he broke into a furious
rage, and arrested both of them, together with Aldobrandino
Rangoni, of Modena, her gentleman, and also, as some say, two of
the women of her chamber, as abettors of this sinful act. He
ordered them to be brought to a hasty trial, desiring the judges to
pronounce sentence, in the accustomed forms, upon the culprits.
This sentence was death. Some there were that bestirred themselves
in favour of the delinquents, and, amongst others, Ugoccion
Contrario, who was all-powerful with Niccolo, and also his aged
and much deserving minister Alberto dal Sale. Both of these, their
tears flowing down their cheeks, and upon their knees, implored
him for mercy; adducing whatever reasons they could suggest for
sparing the offenders, besides those motives of honour and decency
which might persuade him to conceal from the public so scandalous
a deed. But his rage made him inflexible, and, on the instant, he
commanded that the sentence should be put in execution.
</p><p>
"It was, then, in the prisons of the castle, and exactly in those
frightful dungeons which are seen at this day beneath the chamber
called the Aurora, at the foot of the Lion's tower, at the top of the
street Giovecca, that on the night of the 21st of May were beheaded,
first, Ugo, and afterwards Parisina. Zoese, he that accused her,
conducted the latter under his arm to the place of punishment. She,
all along, fancied that she was to be thrown into a pit, and asked at
every step, whether she was yet come to the spot? She was told
that her punishment was the axe. She enquired what was become
of Ugo, and received for answer, that he was already dead; at
which, sighing grievously, she exclaimed, 'Now, then, I wish not
myself to live;' and, being come to the block, she stripped herself,
with her own hands, of all her ornaments, and, wrapping a cloth
round her head, submitted to the fatal stroke, which terminated the
cruel scene. The same was done with Rangoni, who, together
with the others, according to two calendars in the library of St.
Francesco, was buried in the cemetery of that convent. Nothing
else is known respecting the women.
</p><p>
"The Marquis kept watch the whole of that dreadful night, and,
as he was walking backwards and forwards, enquired of the captain
of the castle if Ugo was dead yet? who answered him, Yes. He
then gave himself up to the most desperate lamentations, exclaiming,
'Oh! that I too were dead, since I have been hurried on to
resolve thus against my own Ugo!' And then gnawing with his
teeth a cane which he had in his hand, he passed the rest of the night
in sighs and in tears, calling frequently upon his own dear Ugo.
On the following day, calling to mind that it would be necessary to
make public his justification, seeing that the transaction could not
be kept secret, he ordered the narrative to be drawn out upon paper,
and sent it to all the courts of Italy.
</p><p>
"On receiving this advice, the Doge of Venice, Francesco Foscari,
gave orders, but without publishing his reasons, that stop
should be put to the preparations for a tournament, which, under
the auspices of the Marquis, and at the expense of the city of Padua,
was about to take place, in the square of St. Mark, in order to
celebrate his advancement to the ducal chair.
</p><p>
"The Marquis, in addition to what he had already done, from
some unaccountable burst of vengeance, commanded that as many
of the married women as were well known to him to be faithless,
like his Parisina, should, like her, be beheaded. Amongst others,
Barberina, or, as some call her, Laodamia Romei, wife of the court
judge, underwent this sentence, at the usual place of execution;
that is to say, in the quarter of St. Giacomo, opposite the present
fortress, beyond St. Paul's. It cannot be told how strange appeared
this proceeding in a prince, who, considering his own disposition,
should, as it seemed, have been in such cases most
indulgent. Some, however, there were who did not fail to
commend him." [<i>Memorie per la Storia di Ferrara</i>, Raccolte da

Putting Lady Macbeth out of the question, the situation may be

</p>
<blockquote><p>"I was last night abroad at supper; Julia was a-bed before my
return. I found her lute lying on the table, and a music-book open
by it. I could perceive the marks of tears shed on the paper, and
the air was such as might encourage their falling. Sleep, however,
had overcome her sadness, and she did not awake when I opened
the curtain to look on her. When I had stood some moments, I
heard her sigh strongly through her sleep, and presently she muttered
some words, I know not of what import. I had sometimes heard
her do so before, without regarding it much; but there was something
that roused my attention now. I listened; she sighed again,
and again spoke a few broken words. At last I heard her plainly
pronounce the name Savillon two or three times, and each time it was
accompanied with sighs so deep that her heart seemed bursting as
it heaved then."]

INTRODUCTION TO <i>POEMS OF THE SEPARATION.</i>
<br /><span class="center"><img src="images/decoration.png" alt="swash" /></span>
</h2>


<p>The two poems, <i>Fare Thee Well</i> (March 17) and <i>A Sketch</i>
(March 29, 1816), which have hitherto been entitled
<i>Domestic Pieces</i>, or <i>Poems on His Own Circumstances</i>,
I have ventured to rename <i>Poems of the Separation</i>.
Of secondary importance as poems or works of art, they stand out by
themselves as marking and helping to make the critical
epoch in the life and reputation of the poet. It is to be
observed that there was an interval of twelve days between
the date of <i>Fare Thee Well</i> and <i>A Sketch</i>; that the composition
of the latter belongs to a later episode in the
separation drama; and that for some reasons connected with
the proceedings between the parties, a pathetic if not uncritical
resignation had given place to the extremity of
exasperation&mdash;to hatred and fury and revenge. It follows
that either poem, in respect of composition and of publication,
must be judged on its own merits. Contemporary
critics, while they were all but unanimous in holding up

<i>A Sketch</i> to unqualified reprobation, were divided with
regard to the good taste and good faith of <i>Fare Thee Well</i>.
Moore intimates that at first, and, indeed, for some years
after the separation, he was strongly inclined to condemn
the <i>Fare Thee Well</i> as a histrionic performance&mdash;"a showy
effusion of sentiment;" but that on reading the account of all
the circumstances in Byron's <i>Memoranda</i>, he was impressed
by the reality of the "swell of tender recollections, under the
influence of which, as he sat one night musing in his study,
these stanzas were produced&mdash;the tears, as he said, falling
fast over the paper as he wrote them" (<i>Life</i>, p. 302).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[532]</a></span></p>

<p>With whatever purpose, or under whatever emotion the
lines were written, Byron did not keep them to himself.
They were shown to Murray, and copies were sent to "the
initiated." "I have just received," writes Murray, "the
enclosed letter from Mrs. Maria Graham [1785-1842, <i>n&eacute;e</i>
Dundas, authoress and traveller, afterwards Lady Callcott],
to whom I had sent the verses. It will show you that you
are thought of in the remotest corners, and furnishes me
with an excuse for repeating that I shall not forget you.
God bless your Lordship. Fare <i>Thee</i> Well" [MSS. M.].</p>

<p>But it does not appear that they were printed in their
final shape (the proof of a first draft, consisting of thirteen
stanzas, is dated March 18, 1816) till the second copy of
verses were set up in type with a view to private distribution
(see <i>Letters</i>, 1899, iii. 279). Even then there was no
thought of publication on the part of Byron or of Murray,
and, as a matter of fact, though <i>Fare Thee Well</i> was included
in the "Poems" of 1816, it was not till both poems had
appeared in over twenty pirated editions that <i>A Sketch</i> was
allowed to appear in vol. iii. of the Collected Works of 1819.
Unquestionably Byron intended that the "initiated," whether
foes or sympathizers, should know that he had not taken his
dismissal in silence; but it is far from certain that he connived
at the appearance of either copy of verses in the public press.
It is impossible to acquit him of the charge of appealing to a
limited circle of specially chosen witnesses and advocates in
a matter which lay between himself and his wife, but the
aggravated offence of rushing into print may well be attributed
to "the injudicious zeal of a friend," or the "malice
prepense" of an enemy. If he had hoped that the verses
would slip into a newspaper, as it were, <i>malgr&eacute; lui</i>, he would
surely have taken care that the seed fell on good ground
under the favouring influence of Perry of the <i>Morning
Chronicle</i>, or Leigh Hunt of the <i>Examiner</i>. As it turned
out, the first paper which possessed or ventured to publish a
copy of the "domestic pieces" was the <i>Champion</i>, a Tory
paper, then under the editorship of John Scott (1783-1821),
a man of talent and of probity, but, as Mr. Lang puts it
(<i>Life and Letters</i> of John Gibson Lockhart, 1897, i. 256),
"Scotch, and a professed moralist." The date of publication<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[533]</a></span>

was Sunday, April 14, and it is to be noted that the
<i>Ode from the French</i> ("We do not curse thee, Waterloo") had been
published in the <i>Morning Chronicle</i> on March 15, and that
on the preceding Sunday, April 7, the brilliant but unpatriotic
apostrophe to the <i>Star of the Legion of Honour</i> had
appeared in the <i>Examiner</i>. "We notice it [this strain of
his Lordship's harp]," writes the editor, "because we think it
would not be doing justice to the merits of such political
tenets, if they were not coupled with their corresponding
practice in regard to moral and domestic obligations.
There is generally a due proportion kept in 'the music of
men's lives.' ... Of many of the <i>facts</i> of this distressing
case we are not ignorant; but God knows they are not for a
newspaper. Fortunately they fall within very general knowledge,
in London at least; if they had not they would never
have found their way to us. But there is a respect due to
certain wrongs and sufferings that would be outraged by
uncovering them." It was all very mysterious, very terrible;
but what wonder that the laureate of the ex-emperor, the
contemner of the Bourbons, the p&aelig;anist of the "star of the
brave," "the rainbow of the free," should make good his
political heresy by personal depravity&mdash;by unmanly vice,
unmanly whining, unmanly vituperation?</p>

<p>Wordsworth, to whom Scott forwarded the <i>Champion</i> of
April 14, "outdid" the journalist in virtuous fury: "Let me
say only one word of Lord B. The man is insane. The
verses on his private affairs excite in me less indignation
than pity. The latter copy is the Billingsgate of Bedlam.
... You yourself seem to labour under some delusion as to
the merits of Lord B.'s poetry, and treat the wretched verses,
the <i>Fare Well</i>, with far too much respect. They are disgusting
in sentiment, and in execution contemptible. 'Though
my many faults deface me,' etc. Can worse doggerel than
such a stanza be written? One verse is commendable: 'All
my madness none can know.'" The criticism, as criticism,
confutes itself, and is worth quoting solely because it displays
the feeling of a sane and honourable man towards a member
of the "opposition," who had tripped and fallen, and now lay
within reach of his lash (see <i>Life of William Wordsworth</i>,
1889, ii. 267, etc.).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[534]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not only, as Macaulay put it, that Byron was
"singled out as an expiatory sacrifice" by the British public
in a periodical fit of morality, but, as the extent and the
limitations of the attack reveal, occasion was taken by
political adversaries to inflict punishment for an outrage on
popular sentiment.</p>

<p>The <i>Champion</i> had been the first to give tongue, and the
other journals, on the plea that the mischief was out, one after
the other took up the cry. On Monday, April 15, the <i>Sun</i>

printed <i>Fare Thee Well</i>, and on Tuesday, April 16, followed
with <i>A Sketch</i>. On the same day the <i>Morning Chronicle</i>,
protesting that "the poems were not written for the public
eye, but as having been inserted in a Sunday paper," printed
both sets of verses; the <i>Morning Post</i>, with an ugly hint that
"the noble Lord gives us verses, when he dare not give us
circumstances," restricted itself to <i>Fare Thee Well</i>; while
the <i>Times</i>, in a leading paragraph, feigned to regard "the
two extraordinary copies of verses ... the whining stanzas
of <i>Fare Thee Well</i>, and the low malignity and miserable
doggerel of the companion <i>Sketch</i>," as "an injurious fabrication."
On Thursday, the 18th, the <i>Courier</i>, though declining
to insert <i>A Sketch</i>, deals temperately and sympathetically
with the <i>Fare Thee Well</i>, and quotes the testimony of a
"fair correspondent" (? Madame de Sta&euml;l), that if "her
husband had bade her such a farewell she could not have
avoided running into his arms, and being reconciled
immediately&mdash;'Je n'aurois pu m'y tenir un instant';" and on the
same day the <i>Times</i>, having learnt to its "extreme astonishment
and regret," that both poems were indeed Lord Byron's,
maintained that the noble author had "degraded literature,
and abused the privileges of rank, by converting them into
weapons of vengeance against an inferior and a female."
On Friday, the 19th, the <i>Star</i> printed both poems, and the

<i>Morning Post</i> inserted a criticism, which had already
appeared in the <i>Courier</i> of the preceding day. On Saturday,
the 20th, the <i>Courier</i> found itself compelled, in the interests
of its readers, to print both poems. On Sunday, the 21st,
the octave of the original issue, the <i>Examiner</i> devoted a
long article to an apology for Byron, and a fierce rejoinder
to the <i>Champion</i>; and on the same day the
<i>Independent Whig</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[535]</a></span>

and the <i>Sunday News</i>,
which favoured the "opposition,"
printed both poems, with prefatory notices more or
less favourable to the writer; whereas the Tory
<i>Antigallican Monitor</i>, which also printed both poems,
added the significant
remark that "if everything said of Lord Byron be true,
it would appear that the Whigs were not altogether so
immaculate as they themselves would wish the world to suppose."</p>

<p>The testimony of the press is instructive from two points
of view. In the first place, it tends to show that the controversy
was conducted on party lines; and, secondly, that
the editor of the <i>Champion</i> was in some degree responsible
for the wide diffusion and lasting publicity of the scandal.
The separation of Lord and Lady Byron must, in any case,
have been more than a nine days' wonder, but if the circulation
of the "pamphlet" had been strictly confined to the
"initiated," the excitement and interest of the general public
would have smouldered and died out for lack of material.</p>

<p>In his second letter on Bowles, dated March 25, 1821
(<i>Observations upon Observations</i>, <i>Life</i>, 1892, p. 705), Byron
alludes to the publication of these poems in the <i>Champion</i>,
and comments on the behaviour of the editor, who had
recently (February 16, 1821) been killed in a duel. He does
not minimize the wrong, but he pays a fine and generous
tribute to the courage and worth of his assailant. "Poor
Scott is now no more ...he died like a brave man, and he
lived an able one," etc. It may be added that Byron was
an anonymous subscriber to a fund raised by Sir James
Mackintosh, Murray, and others, for "the helpless family of
a man of virtue and ability" (<i>London Magazine</i>, April, 1821,
vol. iii. p. 359).</p>

<p>For chronological reasons, and in accordance with the
precedent of the edition of 1832, a third poem,
<i>Stanzas to Augusta</i>, has been included in this group.
